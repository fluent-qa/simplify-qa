## Clients 
API clients provide a browser for technical and non-technical users to explore APIs, simplify authentication, working with parameters, headers, and other details of working with APIs. 

### Types 
There are different types of API clients, allowing anyone to work with different types of APIs that are employing a variety of protocols and patterns. 

- **REST** - Allowing for calls to be made to a REST API, enabling users to be able to easily make requests and see responses without having to write code. 
- **GraphQL** - Allowing for calls to be made to a GraphQL API, enabling users to be able to easily craft queries, make requests, and see responses without having to write code. 
- **gRPC** - Allowing for calls to be made to a gRPC API, enabling users to be able to invoke connections to gRPC services and work with responses without writing code. 
- **WebSockets** - Allowing for calls to be made to a Websockets API, enabling users to be able to connect to asynchronous APIs, publishing and subscribing data without having to write code. 
- **SOAP** - Allowing for calls to be made to a SOAP API, enabling users to POST requests to web services and work with the responses without having to write code. 
There are other patterns and protocols available, but these reflect the top areas in which API consumers are needing to work with the APIs they need to put to work. 
Web and desktop API clients make it easy for APis to be put to work without needing to develop an application, helping anyone reverse engineer the APIs being used across business operations.
