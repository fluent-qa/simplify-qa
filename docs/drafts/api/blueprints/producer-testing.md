## Producer - Testing 
This area of the API life cycle is focused on streamlining, documenting, and automating the testing of the underlying contract for each API. It is about understanding the overall performance of the API and its integration and running other types of tests. Testing should include automation to properly scrutinize the entire surface area of each API, as well as the operations surrounding it, helping teams do more work and consistently contribute to the quality of all APIs. 

### Elements 
 

- **Collections** - Use collections to define one or many API requests, establishing a modular, collaborative, and executable artifact used across API testing. 
- **Scripts** - Define folder-level, pre-request, or post-request scripts that will run as you configure requests, validate responses, and automate testing to run as you iterate and respond to consumer behavior. 
- **Contract** - Use OpenAPI and AsyncAPI contracts to ensure that 100% of the surface area of an API is tested and behavior reflects the contract between producer and consumer. 
- **Performance** - Test specific paths for each API in multiple regions to make sure the API, gateway, and network provide the desired performance. 
- **Mocking** - Use mock servers generated from the API contract, then augment them with examples for specific use cases, testing for specific outcomes. 
- **Data** - Inject CSV or JSON data as part of the testing process, making sue API requests reflect specific business workflows and outcomes. Test real-world API-driven scenarios. 
- **Monitors** - Schedule testing monitors to run on a schedule reflecting the business needs of the API, but also the type of test being run, allowing teams to automate testing. 
 
While there are always specific nuances to testing an API, the majority of testing can be realized with these common elements. A consistent approach to testing across all APIs helps ensure quality and provides a consistent template for what testing is, allowing
it to be governed across all teams. Standardizing how teams test APIs is essential to achieving the reliability you will need across the thousands of APIs you will use to do business in the future.
