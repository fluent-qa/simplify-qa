### Elements 
These are the common elements of search. 

- **APIs** - Providing programmatic interfaces for a variety of desktop, web, mobile, device, and other applications using HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, TCP, MQTT, and other protocols, while supporting a mix of patterns like REST, RPC, GraphQL, and event-driven to meet the growing demands of increasingly digital organizations. 
- **Workspaces** - A virtual space for doing API work, providing a location that has a name, description, and private, team, partner, or public visibility, where work on APIs, collections, mock servers, environments, monitors, and other elements of API operations can exist, providing a single location for API producers and consumers to engage across the API lifecycle, and move APIs forward in a collaborative way. 
- **Teams** - The team of people who are behind API operations, providing name, role, and other relevant details about who they are and what they will be contributing to API operations, helping manage the human side of operations, allowing hundreds or thousands of team members to be organized and managed for optimal delivery and consumption of APIs across operations. 
- **SDKs** - You can generate complete software development kits, abstracting away the authentication and other complex aspects of deploying APIs. You always want to reduce the workload for consumers, easing integration of your APIs into their applications. 
- **Documentation** - Documentation published as human consumable HTML pages help potential API consumers learn about what an API does by describing the paths, channels, parameters, headers, schema, messages, and other building blocks of APIs, showing examples of what is possible or by providing an API client to make calls to each API as part of the documentation. 
- **Tests** - Provide collection security testsâ€“modular, reusable, executable, and fully documented tests for all of the most common vulnerabilities your teams will face. 
- **Mock Servers** - A mock server helps replicate as much of the functionality and API would have in production, before the time to actually have to write any code, making APIs be more tangible and real early on in the lifecycle, allowing teams to rapidly design an API that meets the needs of everyone involved, providing usable elements that power design, documentation, testing, and other elements of the API lifecycle.
