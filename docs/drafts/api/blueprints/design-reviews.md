## Design Reviews 
API design reviews make you give pause before any API goes into production, making sure every API meets your organization’s design standards. Designers and developers should have a wealth of resources to help them design the best possible API before it ever gets submitted. Each API submitted as part of an API design review process should possess the necessary artifacts and elements needed to properly evaluate its design. 

### Define 
Each API being submitted as part of an API design review process should possess the necessary artifacts and elements needed to properly evaluate the design of each API. To ensure the API design review is as efficient and effective as possible it helps to have a dedicated location for the review to happen, with everything present to conduct a review, and provide feedback around the API, as well as supporting elements. Setting the state for a speedy but effective review, sending an API back to development, or allowing it to move everything forward to production. 

- **Workspaces** - Ground API design reviews with a dedicated API workspace where you can find everything you need to review the state of the proposed API design from teams. 
- **Contracts** - There is always a contract available for the API, allowing self- service automated review, but also to make sure the teams and reviewer are on the same page. 
- **Documentation** - Provide documentation for the entire surface area of an API, allowing human reviewers to understand the API, and teams to articulate the value. 
- **Mock Servers** - Publish a mocked representation of APIs under review, allowing everyone involved to understand what an API does by playing with the mock server.

### Process 
Once you’re ready and have all the needed artifacts and elements, your API should be subjected to a well-defined process for reviewing its design and providing feedback, including whether it is ready for production. 

- **Self-Service** - Provide as much of the design review process and feedback as possible in a self-service format, with modular services, tooling, and rules for teams to use. 
- **Timeline** - Establish a timeline for how long design reviews should take, holding all stakeholders accountable achieving the desired outcomes within a specified timeframe. 
- **Feedback** - Provide formal, documented, and constructive feedback for teams about the design of their API, but also allow teams to provide feedback on the process. 
- **Outcomes** - Defining the outcomes of a design review, regularly assessing the process and the reality on the ground with teams to make sure reviews provide value.

Design reviews should not be seen as yet another gate developers need to get through. They provide an opportunity for educating teams about best practices. They also establish a feedback loop with teams to help you learn where they need help.
