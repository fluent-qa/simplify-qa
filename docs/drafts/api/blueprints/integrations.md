## Integrations 
The enterprise digital landscape is increasingly made up of internal and external interconnected systems. Modern web APIs define how these systems interoperate,
and how they can evolve and be automated. APIs are connecting all parts of enterprise operations, leveraging internal and external APIs to stitch together the expanding digital landscape required to do business today. 

### Elements 
 

- **SaaS** - APIs enable the SaaS solutions we depend on to run our businesses to run seamlessly with existing enterprise operations, allowing aspects of business to be outsourced while still maintaining control over usage.
 
- **Infrastructure** - The existing infrastructure likely already possesses APIs, providing a huge opportunity for more automation and orchestration across the software already in place. This is your low-hanging fruit.
 
- **Interoperability** - APIs define how distributed and federated parts of enterprise operations are made interoperable, and how acquisitions, partners, and industry- level interoperability is set into motion. APIs reduce the challenges involved in working across business divides. 
- **Syncing** - Syncing data across operations and with external partners and services is a regular part of business operations. APIs enable you to do that as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible, allowing for more alignment across business domains. 
- **Migrations** - APIs are how data and objects are migrated between servers, clouds, partners, and other constructs of our regular operations. They ensure that small or large amounts of data are made accessible, so that they can be migrated to a new location for optimal usage.
 
- **Automation** - The only way an organization can remain competitive in this digital landscape is through the automation of common business processes. APIs define those processes and the digital resources they depend on, providing the information t we need to automate them.
 
- **Orchestration** - APIs provide the knobs and levers that can be scheduled, triggered, and pulled to keep business moving forward, producing just the right performance for our operations. 
 
The average enterprise landscape has thousands of connected servers and platforms. APIs determine how they are made whole (or left operating in isolation). APIs are essential to the interoperability of a distributed enterprise and the industry it operates in.
