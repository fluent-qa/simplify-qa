## Gateway Differentiators 
Gateways do a lot of things. While the core gateway capabilities are fairly short, the list of policies and ways you can extend the legacy and modern gateway is expansive. However, there are a handful of areas that really differentiate the next-generation gateways from what is the status quo. 

### Differentiators 
These are the differentiators. 

- **Multi-Cloud** - APIs are deployed in multiple clouds without friction. 
- **Multi-Protocol** - Switching between the protocols is effortless. 
- **Multi-Region** - Operate across multiple regions without more work. 
- **Contracts** - Everything is contract-defined and driven by default. 
- **Policies** - Policies are easy to define and apply across any gateway. 
- **Federated** - A federated approach is supported as the default. 
- **GitOps** - Woven into the fabric of existing source control & CI/CD. 
- **Edge** - Easily deployed as close to consumers as possible. 
- **Programmability** - Allowing for simple and effective programming. 
- **Extensibility** - Quick to extend gateway with entirely new capabilities. 
- **Local** - Enabling developers to work locally with the same capabilities. 
- **Observability** - Making APIs, contracts, and operations observable. 
Those were the differentiators.
