## The API Moves to the Cloud 
In 2006, Amazon forever changed how we do business on the web with the release of Amazon Web Services, demonstrating that you can deploy global infrastructure using simple web APIs. Amazon S3 and EC2 not only changed how we would do business, they showed us the way forward for delivering the industrial-grade digital building blocks we needed with APIs. 

### AWS Services 
 

- **S3** - Through its internalization of an API-first mentality, Amazon began to see their infrastructure in different ways, rethinking how they made storage available not just to scale their operations, but also by introducing Amazon Web Services, providing others with storage in the clouds. 
- **EC2** - On the heels of storage in the clouds, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched 4EC2 and elastic compute services for deploying different sizes of servers for hosting websites, APIs, and anything else you would need to host, paying only for what you used. 
- **RDS** - Continuing its expansion across essential IT infrastructure, AWS launched RDS, making common database platforms available as scalable APIs, providing MySQL, and eventually SQL Server, Postgres, and other fundamental data solutions to suit enterprise needs. 
 
### The AWS origin myth 
According to a famous blog post by former Amazon engineer Steve Yegge, sometime around 2002, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos issued a mandate to his still-young startup online retail business, changing not just the DNA of Amazon, but the way we would define our businesses in the years ahead. He stated:
• All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.
• Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
• There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct
linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, and no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.
• It doesn’t matter what technology they use.
• All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to
be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. 

- **Expose Data** - All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. 
- **No Direct Communication** - There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no directlinking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, and no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. 
- **Technology Use** - It doesn’t matter what technology they use. 
- **No Exceptions** - All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. 
The mandate closed with: Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired. Thank you; have a nice day!
This landmark API-first mandate at Amazon would change the trajectory of the online retailer, but also set in motion another division that would eventually rival its core business, and change how companies operate across almost every sector.
Time has shown that the AWS origin story is more myth than reality, but it doesn’t matter. The AWS story is part of API folklore and is used to describe API-first transformations across almost every industry impacted by APIs today.
