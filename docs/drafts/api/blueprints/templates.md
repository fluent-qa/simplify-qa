## Templates 
Common, reusable, and standardized templates enable teams to move faster while delivering more consistent and reusable APIs. That reduces time, money, and friction downstream. Reusable components often begin with design patterns that can be applied during the define and design stages of the API life cycle, but can expand rapidly to include almost every other stop along the lifecycle. 

### Elements 
 

- **Simple** - Provide simple templates that reduce the cognitive load for learning new standards and patterns to produce APIs. 
- **Modular** - Keep templates modular and reusable, daisy-chaining concepts together into large patterns, workflows, and processes for moving APIs forward. 
- **Starter** - Offer entire starter kits to teams when starting a new API, providing a complete example of the preferred way for designing, developing, and operating APIs. 
- **Contracts** - Maintain a catalog of complete contracts showing implementations of different types. This allows for easy editing and sets new APIs into motion. 
- **Components** - Leverage the components object for OpenAPI and AsyncAPI contracts, providing a rich set of templates that can be used to rapidly design new API contracts. 
- **Extensions** - Use extensions for OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, going beyond what each specification can do and providing templates teams can use across the API life cycle. 
- **Rules** - Set template rules for linting different artifacts, helping jumpstart the use of common rules and the development of new ones to help govern operations. 
- **Policies** - Provide standardized policies and starter templates to apply across the API life cycle, helping to centralize policy management while federating usage. 
 
Templates help enable teams to do the right things across the API lifecycle, helping provide the common parts and pieces of delivering APIs. They help teams focus on the unique experiences your enterprise provides to consumers via APIs.
Think of API operations as a bucket of Lego bricks, where the reusable components are the red, blue, and yellow bricks and your API strategy uses these bricks in a variety of strategic kits or templates to deliver the business outcomes leaders are looking for. All teams have to do is build templates, allowing other teams to assemble new and interesting experiences using raw bricks.
