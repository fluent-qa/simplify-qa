## Usability 
The overall usability of the APIs behind enterprise applications and integrations contribute to the efficiency and velocity of an organization. As the result of ad hoc API operations, we see many common challenges when it comes to the usability of APIs across an organization, which if addressed would significantly shift the speed at which an organization can move. 

### Elements 
These are the elements of usability when it comes to API operations. 

- **Documentation** - Documentation published as human consumable HTML pages help potential API consumers learn about what an API does by describing the paths, channels, parameters, headers, schema, messages, and other building blocks of APIs, showing examples of what is possible or by providing an API client to make calls to each API as part of the documentation. 
- **Design** - The functional shape, surface, and details of any type of an API provided in a way that can be collaborated around and shared with other stakeholders, providing a set of human and machine-readable instructions for what each API is able to do that demonstrates a great deal of thought has gone into its form and function. 
- **Onboarding** - Offering a consistent and well-defined onboarding experience for all APIs, making it as easy and straightforward for consumers to onboard with an API, while also providing API producers with an easy way to onboard new consumers with their APIs without any custom work required, reducing friction when it comes to putting APIs to work by utilizing well-known approaches to onboarding. 
- **Simplicity** -  
- **Value** -
