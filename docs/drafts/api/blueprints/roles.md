## Roles 
A growing number of job roles have become involved in API operations, from defining their capabilities to distributing them and iterating upon the design to bring them into alignment with consumer needs and business objectives. For companies further along in their API journey, APIs are no longer just an IT-led effort, but one that requires a mix of skills and cross-cutting roles to move APIs forward in a productive, reliable, and consistent manner. 

### The different roles 
 

- **Product Manager** - APIs are increasingly being treated as products. Project managers keep the road map for APIs in alignment with consumer needs and the goals of business stakeholders, including those in sales and marketing. 
- **Software Architect** - Organizations are leaning on software architects to define the technical details of defining and designing APIs. They help establish common contracts for schema r that API developers can use. 
- **Developers** - Specialized backend developers focus on designing, developing, and delivering consistent and intuitive microservices and APIs that meet the needs of consumers and align with wider business objectives. 
- **Test Engineer** - The development of contract, performance, and other types of tests required to deliver high-quality, reliable APIs is increasingly implemented by test engineers. They are often part of a skills QA team that understands API nuances. 
- **Information Security** - The information security role goes beyond application security and other security teams.These people understand the specialized needs for securing APIs, whether they are applied as private, partner, or public applications and integrations. 
- **Deployments** - It’s important to centralize the release of APIs, ensuring that they are deployed in a repeatable and consistent way and helping load-balance the journey from development to production across developer teams. 
- **Operations** - Once APIs are in production, SREs, DevOps, and other operations roles are stepping in to ensure they are observable and that the life cycles surrounding them are also observable across all relevant roles. 
- **Product Marketing** - After APIs are ready for consumption, product marketers step in to drive distribution. They make sure that APIs are discoverable and that consumers engage with each version. 
 
While some of these roles may already be familiar to your team, it’s essential to understand where they fit in the API life cycle and how they work in concert to consistently and reliably deliver new APIs and iterate upon them. You should maproles for each stop along the API life cycle, then educate stakeholders about the mix of responsibilities. That will help you establish clear ownership across teams, reducing friction at every stage of the life cycle.
