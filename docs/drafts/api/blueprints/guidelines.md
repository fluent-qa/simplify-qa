## Guidelines 
Governance guidelines are commonly used to inform all stakeholders in the API life cycle about API strategy. They express how teams should be pushing APIs across a common API life cycle. Guidelines help govern not just the design, but every other stop along this life cycle. They are essential to getting teams on the same page as they produce APIs across operations. 

### Elements 
 

- **Strategy** - The API strategy distills the plan into something that can be articulated across the organization, speaking to both technical and business groups. 
- **Protocols** - Itâ€™s important to establish a toolbox of protocols available to teams, providing a baseline for protocol selection and application. 
- **Patterns** - A catalog of common patterns provides examples of how to define, design, develop, and operate APIs across a standardized API life cycle for all teams. 
- **Standards** - Document all standards available for designing and developing APIs, offering a fully fleshed-out set of common standards that match each domain. 
- **Templates** - Offer a catalog of common templates, providing examples of how teams can define, design, develop, and operate APIs across a standardized API life cycle. 
- **Errors** - Provide standardized and well-defined guidance for handling errors, ideally following Internet standards. 
- **Security** - Make security policies and practices a part of guidance, providing tools and other resources that shift security left and enable teams to apply best practices early. 
- **Lifecycle** - Document the API life cycle in motion across the enterprise, providing a common vocabulary for describing each stop along the life cycle for teams. 
- **Tooling** - Providing a catalog of the tools available to service every stop along the API life cycle, including a mix of platform, third-party, and open-source solutions for teams. 
 

Your governance guidance should start simple. If you need help, look at the guidelines of top public API providers, then define what matters most to your operations and communicate that to your teams. Then keep iterating upon it, learning from your teams and your consumers. Continue updating your guidance and keep evolving and responding to concerns that matter.
Remember, none of your developers will care about API governance. A lack of governance really boils down to a lack of support and enablement for teams on the ground floor. If your API governance falls short, make sure you review the resources and tools you have provided to your teams.
