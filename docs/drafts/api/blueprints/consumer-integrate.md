## Consumer - Integrate 
There are many ways for consumers to develop against an API. It used to be enough to provide f snippets or libraries in a variety of programming languages, but increasingly, consumers want access to artifacts, collections, and other ways of visually developing their integrations or applications, pushing the boundaries of traditional desktop, web, or mobile applications. 

### Elements 
 

- **Contracts** - Machine-readable contracts like OpenAPI and AsyncAPI make integration as simple as importing the contract for an API, authenticating, and making the API calls you need to move data between systems, providing an artifact that defines consumption.
 
- **Collections** - Provide forkable and executable collections that describe specific parts of an API to help consumers accomplish a specific digital capability. Provide a buffet of capabilities for consumers to choose from for their API integration needs. 
- **Automation** - Take advantage of automation opportunities, allowing collections to be scheduled and baked into the CI/CD pipelines and common business capabilities to be executed. Business and technical stakeholders can do more with less through API automation. 
- **Workflows** - Provide ready-to-go low-code and no-code options for executing common business workflows, allowing multiple internal, partner, and public APIs to be daisy-chained into solutions that will help business and technical stakeholders integrate better.
 
- **Snippets** - You can generate lightweight code snippets in a variety of programming languages. They will do most of the heavy lifting for consumers integrating APIs in the language of their choice, automating the more repetitive aspects of API integration. 
- **SDKs** - You can generate complete software development kits, abstracting away the authentication and other complex aspects of deploying APIs. You always want to reduce the workload for consumers, easing integration of your APIs into their applications. 
 
Todayâ€™s API integrations come in many shapes and sizes, requiring a mix of approaches to satisfy the needs of the widest possible consumer audience. We are moving to a more modular, automated, and low-code/no-code environment when it comes to stitching together the thousands of APIs we need to do business today.

The ways consumers integrate API resources, capabilities, and experiences into their applications, automation, and other types of integrations is rapidly expanding. This rapid expansion is raising the bar for API producers, who must reduce friction and lighten the integration load with proven solutions.
