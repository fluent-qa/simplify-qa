## Stability 
They overall stability of individual APIs and your entire operations is part of the image and brand of your business today. The stability of your operations is not something that will remain constant and change based on how teams move forward with the infrastructure behind your digital resources and capabilities. Stability is much more than just uptime or downtime of APIs and involves a mix of elements that will contribute to how your consumers perceive your business. 

### Elements 
These are the elements of stablity when it comes to API operations. 

- **Contract Testing** - Contract tests can be derived from API artifacts like OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and GraphQL, and used to ensure there are no changes to what has been promised when an API was designed or developed, providing a repeatable test that can be run manually, on a schedule from multiple regions, or as part of a CI/CD pipeline to ensure contracts with consumers are upheld. 
- **Performance Testing** - Performance tests can be defined as individual tests using collections, pulling from one or many individual API paths and measuring the time it takes for the response to be sent, providing a test that can be run manually, scheduled across multiple geographic regions, or executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline, helping ensure an API is always meeting it~s expected performance benchmarks. 
- **Security Testing** - Security tests can be defined for any API using executable and shareable collections, testing for common OWASP vulnerabilities, as well as other more custom scenarios or business approaches, providing a single or suite of security tests that can be manually run, scheduled across multiple regions, or executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline, automating security consistently across APIs. 
- **Governance Testing** -  
- **CI/CD** - Operating in a state of continuous integration and continuous deployment involving APIs, ensuring that the process involved with consuming and producing APIs are as reliable, high quality, and resulting in consistent outcomes that benefit everyone involved, and powers useful applications.
