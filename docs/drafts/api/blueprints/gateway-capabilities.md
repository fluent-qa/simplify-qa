## Gateway Capabilities 
Gateways, which have become essential to enterprise operations, offer a mix of open source or commercial capabilities. Here are a few of the most important: 

### Elements 
 

- **Security** - The security of APIs spans multiple domains, beginning with encryption of API requests and responses in transport, but then moving to identity and access management using keys, tokens, and other standards, while also ensuring that you scan, audit, fuzz, and ensure that the surface area of APIs are free from common vulnerabilities, and malicious actors are unable to get access to the resources and capabilities available via APIs. 
- **Traffic** - Managing the traffic from APIs, considering both the ingress and the egress, and all of the considerations that come with it, providing a whole suite of policies that can be applied to manage traffic in an automated way across API operations. 
- **Mediation** - Needs a description for this elements 
- **Transformation** - Transformation is about shaping the traffic that flows through APIs, filtering, shaping, and cleaning up data as it is passed through an API, better meeting the demands of both the producer and consumer, and ideally with privacy and security considered from end to end. 
- **Virtualization** - In computing, virtualization or virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual, rather than actual version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. Virtualization is used to deliver mock representations of an API for design, and testing, as well as sandbox instances of API to help with onboarding consumers more safely. 
- **Code Execution** - The execution of code in a variety of programming layers, allows the runtime to be extended, introducing new business logic into the execution of any API operation, and augmenting whatever resource or capability is delivered upstream. 
 
There are plenty of other capabilities gateways offer, but these are the leading ways they are used to expose valuable digital resources, capabilities, and experiences. These capabilities provide a baseline for quality, security, and consumer access, striking a balance between access and control over digital resources, capabilities, and experiences.
