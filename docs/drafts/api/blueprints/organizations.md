## Organizations 
Dividing your organization into intentional operational areas is one of the first steps of your API-first transformation. It will shape how your digital resources and capabilities are made available and provide a grounding force for your API life cycles and governance. Organizing your API operations into deliberate bounded contexts reduces complexity and eliminates the unknowns across your digital enterprise landscape. 

### Elements 
 

- **Domains** - Translate the traditional lines of business or tribal boundaries that have emerged over the years into more deliberate spheres of activity and knowledge. That will help you establish bounded contexts for operations, reducing the cognitive load while delivering meaningful API products. 
- **Groups** - Establish designated groups within the enterprise that reflect specific business domains or provide cross-cutting contributions to the API life cycle. That will ensure that API operations–and their underlying infrastructure, workspaces, and teams–are logically grouped to deliver the most effective outcomes. 
- **Teams** - Establish a profile for every human or automated persona that contributes to the API life cycle. Providing a context for individual stakeholders will accelerate the API lifecycle and help move APIs forward at scale. 
- **Roles** - Assign a specific role to each team member, establish access controls to keep teams from stepping on each other’s toes, and stabilize the changes made across operations. 
- **Single Sign On (SSO)** - Provide teams with an authentication scheme allowing them to log in with a single ID across the multiple services they will need to deliver APIs across the API life cycle. 
- **System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)** - Adopt a System for Cross-domain Identity Management, or SCIM, a standard for automating the provisioning and de-provisioning of team member accounts across API operations. A SCIM will make it easier to manage the large number of users required to deliver and operate your APIs.
 
 
API operations can be sprawling, creating friction and challenges among people and teams. Much of the friction can be alleviated with a little organizational alignment. Team composition changes regularly, with t members constantly coming and going. That’s not necessarily bad, but you need structure and automation to ensure people are doing what they should be doing across the API life cycle. Organizational alignment also helps reduce friction over time between development and business teams as your company shifts to meet the needs of your industry.
