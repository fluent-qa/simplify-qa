## Time to First Call 
Time to first call (TTFC) can be the most important API metric, but it?s not the only one. So why is it more important than other metrics, like later-stage usage or performance? As an API publisher, you API journey may look a little different. But the majority of developers ?get it? and ?buy in? once they have a chance to interact with an API on their own terms. Legitimately streamlining TTFC results in a larger market potential of better-educated users for the later stages of your developer journey.

Urgency - Is the developer actively searching for a solution to an existing problem? Or did they hear about your technology in passing and have a mild curiosity?
Constraints - Is the developer trying to meet a deadline? Or do they have unlimited time and budget to explore the possibilities?
Alternative - Is the developer required by their organization to use this solution? Or are they choosing from many providers and considering other ways to solve their problem?

### Influencing Factors 
To understand a developer’s journey, let’s first take a look at factors influencing how much time and energy they are willing to invest in learning your technology and making it work. 

- **Urgency** - Is the developer actively searching for a solution to an existing problem? Or did they hear about your technology in passing and have a mild curiosity? 
- **Sign-up** - Signing up for an account is a developer’s first commitment. It signals their intent to do something with your API. Frequently going hand-in-hand with the next step, signing up is required to generate an API key. 
- **Alternatives** - Is the developer required by their organization to use this solution? Or are they choosing from many providers and considering other ways to solve their problem?

### Steps 
The steps involved with moving API consumers from discovery to actually making an API request, providing a standardized look at how we onboard consumers with our APIs. 

- **Browse** - Having the ability to browse through a network of workspaces, API, documentation, testing, and automation collections that are made available to a private, partner, or public audience, allowing technical and non-technical stakeholders and consumers to find the resources and activity they need. 
- **Sign-up** - Signing up for an account is a developer’s first commitment. It signals their intent to do something with your API. Frequently going hand-in-hand with the next step, signing up is required to generate an API key. 
- **First API call** - Making the first API call is the first payoff a developer receives and is oftentimes when developers begin more deeply understanding how the API fits into their world.  
- **Implementation** - nce a developer understands how the API functions, they apply it to their own applications and accommodate their specific use cases. Be careful of artificially hacking a TTFC, perhaps by hiding away the tricky parts or ignoring the gotchas, as you may be shifting the friction to the implementation stage.  
- **Usage** - Once an API is implemented into production code, a developer decides whether to deepen adoption of your API. They might increase traffic or accommodate other user scenarios. This is when developers take a hard look at latency, responsiveness, flexibility, and scalability.
