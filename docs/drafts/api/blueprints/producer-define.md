## Producer - Define 
APIs are a very abstract digital concept, loosely wrapping a variety of text, documentation, artifacts, and code that define what an API is capable of doing. A thoughtful API life cycle begins by sitting down with all stakeholders and finding a common way of defining each API and how it will move forward over time. 

### Elements 
 

- **Requirements** - What are the requirements for the API? You need to define the business value it will bring to help you guide development and operation. Stakeholders - Identify business and technical stakeholders, including any external partners and consumers who might need to be involved. 
- **Domains** - What domain will an API be operating in?, Define the vocabulary, standards, and other patterns that developers at design and development teams will use. 
- **Regions** - Identify the region(s) where an API will operate so that you can comply with regulations and other business requirements and ensure that APIs are as close to consumers as possible. 
- **Teams** - Line up who will be working on an API, bringing together designers, developers, technical writers, QA specialists, and other roles who will be involved in moving your APIs forward. 
- **Roles** - Define who will have access to what in terms of editing, viewing, and working with APIs, and the operations that move them forward. 
- **Workspaces** - Set up the workspaces where teams will be designing, developing, and managing APIs, then iterating upon them and managing multiple versions. 
- **Change** - Establish the underlying approach for managing change with an API, keeping the versioning, communication, and other elements in alignment with centralized governance. 
- **Road Map** - Road Map - Create a road map for each API, planning for the future from Day One. 
 
A well-executed definition of the API life cycle lays the important groundwork that
will contribute to its usability. You are providing the API with the nutrients it needs to operate. The definition stage may seem like an easy one to skip, but in reality, it is the most important place to begin, laying the foundation for almost every other stop along the way and contributing to velocity.
