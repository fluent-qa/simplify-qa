## Collaborative 
Doing business in the cloud means you can collaborate with internal teams, partner stakeholders, and even the public when it comes to producing and consuming APIs. Connecting technical and non-technical stakeholders when it comes to delivering and applying the digital resources and capabilities that are needed to do business. Allowing tens, hundreds, or even thousands of people to collaborate when it comes to building and using the digital resources and cpabiities that shape how we do business today, but also tomorrow. 

### Elements 
These are the elements of collaboration when it comes to API operations. 

- **Workspaces** - A virtual space for doing API work, providing a location that has a name, description, and private, team, partner, or public visibility, where work on APIs, collections, mock servers, environments, monitors, and other elements of API operations can exist, providing a single location for API producers and consumers to engage across the API lifecycle, and move APIs forward in a collaborative way. 
- **Repositories** - Education about the API life cycle will have to be layered on top of your existing software development lifecycle. You can leverage ( repositories, README, and other common elements to introduce learning opportunities.
 
- **Sharing** - Sharing of elements used to produce or consume APIs across workspaces, externally with consumers, allowing an intended audience to view, download, and access artifacts and other elements of API operations so they and collaborate around the production or consumption of API resources and capabilities. 
- **Comments** - Comments on APIs, collections and other elements of API operations allow for more tightly coupled and inline conversations to occur around entire elements or specific parts and pieces of elements, allowing teams to collaborate and communicate across the API lifecycle. 
- **Watching** -  
- **Forking** -  
- **Discovery** - The ability to find APIs when new applications and integrations are being developed, or maybe a new API is being developed to ensure a version of it doesn~t already exist, at run time as part of a service mesh, or just randomly introducing people to the APIs that exist within an industry or organization.
