## Operational Interoperability 
Ensuring interoperability–among distributed teams, federated groups, lines of businesses, and partners–is the desired state of existence for any organization. While the desire to operate as a single entity may prevail, the reality on the ground is usually distributed in both the physical and the virtual realms. Facilitating interoperability is one of the top reasons for enterprises to invest more in their API operations, ensuring that their business can connect in many different ways when necessary.

- **Distributed** - The more distributed the enterprise is, the greater the demand for interoperability, which gives teams the ability to flex their muscles with APIs. As businesses depend more on distributed services,, we should give as much freedom and agency to teams as possible through APIs. 
- **Standardized** - We always lean on existing internet and industry standards, adopting, iterating, and contributing to them before we develop our own. However, in the absence of existing standards, enterprises should evolve their own common patterns to the status of standards–first across the organization,and possibly at some point, within their industry. 
- **Seamless** - All of our infrastructure and applications are part of a seamless web of business interoperability. We are producing and consuming APIs as rapidly as the business dictates, trying out new services, then working to integrate them with our API platform. We are using APIs, then iterating and evolving beyond them whenever possible. We should see all digital resources and capabilities as seamless and interoperable building blocks. 
- **Event-Driven** - Enterprise systems should be designed to respond to the most meaningful events occurring across our platforms. And the platforms we depend on must allow operations to respond in real time to what is happening across the market. We must allow not just applications, but our enterprise infrastructure to identify, subscribe, and respond to change as it is happening across the seamless platforms we use to do business. 
Interoperability in today’s digital landscape isn’t just nice to have, it is an essential
part of doing business, keeping up with changes across the global marketplace. Interoperability doesn’t put you at a disadvantage with your competition–in fact, it does the opposite, helping you develop the muscles you need to outmaneuver competitors and develop entire new categories of doing business.
