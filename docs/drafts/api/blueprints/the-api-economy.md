## The API Economy 
The phrase “API economy” is often used to describe revenue opportunities accrued from making APIs available to third-party developers. While this represents one slice of the economy, there is a much larger opportunity for API providers ahead. We are seeing waves of startups and enterprises leveraging an API-first approach to provide what consumers are looking for, adding entirely new layers to the global economy. Pioneering services enabled by APIs: 

### Services 
 

- **Ridesharing (ex., Uber)** - APIs shook up the taxi industry, bringing new competition and forcing a very entrenched business sector to move forward with its own digital transformation. Uber’s aggressive API-driven approach connected drivers with people who needed rides worldwide. 
- **Food delivery (ex.,GrubHub, DoorDash, Instacart)** - Grubhub has put APIs to work to enable food and restaurant delivery via mobile phone.We now take these services for granted. APIs also gave Instacart the edge to make delivering groceries and other goods a professional gig. 
- **Alcohol Delivery (ex., Drizly) ** - As with groceries and restaurant food, we now expect to have beer, wine, and spirits brought to our homes, shifting how we drink and socialize. 
 
### Resources 
These are the digital resources that have built the API economy. 

- **Twilio (SMS)** - Twilio made it simple to send and receive SMS messages using a well-defined web API. 
- **SendGrid (Email)** - SendGrid puts enterprise-grade email within reach of fast- growing startups. 
- **Stripe (Payments)** - Stripe abstracted away the complexities of the payment system using APIs. 
- **Google Maps (Maps)** - Google provided an API modeled after the hacks its own developers were using to create maps. 
- **YouTube (Videos)** - Youtube conquered the web using APIs to allow users to embed their videos. 
- **Instagram (Images)** - Instagram used APIs to bring images to mobile devices. 
- **WhatsApp (Messaging)** - WhatsApp modernized global communication using
simple APIs. 
 
All of these services had been tried at one time or another, but it took the perfect storm of APIs, the cloud, our mobile phones, and a pandemic-driven shift in priorities to make them a normal part of how we live.
