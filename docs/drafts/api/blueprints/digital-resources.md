### Some Common Resources 
The modern enterprise is made up of hundreds or thousands of individual digital resources stored in databases and file systems, and put to work across a dizzying array of desktop, web, mobile, and other types of applications or integrations. You see the vast inventory of enterprise digital resources in browser URLs and in the digital experiences we encounter in our personal and professional lives. These resources shape our offline and online experiences each day as we engage at work and at home on our mobile devices.

These are just a handful of the most common digital resources we all encounter each day. There are millions more. Your API catalog should represent all of the raw digital resources your enterprise depends upon, and your API networks should help you make these raw resources available to the consumers who need them the most.
