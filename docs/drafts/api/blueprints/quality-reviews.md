## Quality Reviews 

A quality review, either manual or automated, can assess the overall quality of each API implementation, looking at how the API is being deployed and sustained. Quality reviews can be done at a certain milestone in API development, or exist as a checklist that teams can follow as they define, design, and deploy each API. 

### Elements 
 

- **Workspaces** - A quality review of a workspace can check that there is a logical name and description of the work occurring, while also considering visibility, RBAC, and other common concerns. 
- **Repository** - Linking Git repositories to API workspaces helps accommodate different sources of truth and development workflows, while helping keep API artifacts, services, and tools available for use across the API life cycle. 
- **Documentation** - Validating that documentation is available for each API helps reduce friction with consumers, ensuring they have adequate information about naming, descriptions, errors, authentication, and other aspects that could cause friction. 
- **Examples** - A quality review can check to see if there are examples available for each individual API path, channel, or other dimension, providing simple examples of what consumers can expect when integrating APIs into their applications. 
- **Mock Servers** - Having a mock server makes it easy for onboarding and testing APIs, reducing friction for consumers who may want to play around with them as they consider adoption. 
- **Contract Testing** - Require every API to possess contract testing for 100% of the surface area. That will provide you a nice baseline of quality, ensuring that every API respects the contract that was agreed upon by API producers and consumers. 
- **Performance Testing** - Check to see if performance tests are included in quality reviews. They will help you further establish a baseline for quality. 
- **Monitoring** - A quality review can check API monitoring, for example, requiring that every API be monitored on a regular schedule. Results can be published to existing APM solutions or viewed via your API platform reporting.
 
 
Quality reviews can simply be a checklist to remind API developers and other stakeholders of what each API needs. They can also provide an opportunity for teams to review each otherâ€™s APIs, or leverage a centralized group to review every API as it moves to production. Quality reviews ensure that APIs are operated consistently across teams. They also give you an opportunity to engage with teams about how they deliver and iterate upon APIs and discover what they need to improve their processes.
