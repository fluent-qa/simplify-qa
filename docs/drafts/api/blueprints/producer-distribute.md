## Producer - Distribute 
An API does little good if it can’t be found and put to use. Distributing an API, as well as the supporting operations around it, ensures that consumers can find it when building applications and integrations. It also means teams will be less likely to create redundant APIs. 

### Elements 
 

- **Portals** - An API deployed into production should be published to the central portal, providing centralized access for internal or external consumers through a single doorway that can be supported as part of overall API operations. 
- **Catalogs** - The metadata for each API should be updated and kept in sync, ensuring that all the information consumers will need is available in the catalog and keeping the catalog up to date.
 
- **Network** - APIs should be published to the private, partner, and public networks where API consumers are, via the platforms they are already using. Tap into existing network effects for API consumers so your developers can meet them where they already are. 
- **Workspaces** - The workspaces around an API should also be made available via the network, providing teams and consumers access to API operations. behind APIs. Expose not just the APIs, but also the work, artifacts, and resources behind them. 
- **Visibility** - The visibility of each API, whether it is private, partner, or public, should be deployed deliberately and confidently, making sure each API is available to consumers and striking a balance between access and control to meet desired business outcomes. 
- **Content** - Publish blog posts, videos, and other content to support the distribution of APIs, articulating the value an API delivers in a way that is discoverable by consumers. Remember to include rich keywords and other necessary metadata. 
- **Buttons** - The documentation, tests, and workspace behind an API should be made available via blog posts, videos, wikis, and other resources to support APIs. Use embeddable and actionable buttons that consumers can activate with one click. 
- **Search** - APIs and the operations around them should be indexed and made available via search. That gives teams, business stakeholders, and consumers the ability to search for and find what they need before building new APIs, applications, or integrations. 
 
The distribution of APIs plays an essential part in both production and consumption. Developers’ lack of attention to distribution impacts discovery and feedback loops for APIs, limiting usage and depriving them of valuable information they could use to iterate and provide consumers with features they want.

Developers can distribute APIs, but it is best done by product managers, marketers, and others who are more attuned to business needs. They will be sure to select the right metadata and ensure that portals, catalogs, networks, and content are closely aligned with business goals.
