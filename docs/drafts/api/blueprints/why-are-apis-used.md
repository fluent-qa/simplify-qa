- **Expose Data** - All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. 
- **No Direct Communication** - There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no directlinking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, and no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. 
- **Technology Use** - It doesn’t matter what technology they use. 
- **No Exceptions** - All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.
