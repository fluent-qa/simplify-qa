## Observability 
The observability of API operations is essential to understanding the state of the enterprise and provide the ability to make changes and control the direction a business takes. 

### Elements 
The elements of observability help leverage existing outputs of API operations to help make the technical and business aspects of the digital resources and capabilities that we depend on something we can see on a daily basis. 

- **Workspaces** - Understanding activity across workspaces, providing a snapshot of the factory floor across API operations. 
- **Activity** - Possessing an understanding of how APIs are being changed and evolved across teams, providing a clear picture of what teams are working on across operations. 
- **Performance** - Establishing a complete picture of the performance of APIs in use behind applications and integrations, piping all collection runs into APM solutions. 
- **Governance** - Leveraging rules and policies applied across APIs by teams to benchmark the progress being made when it comes to delivering consistent APIs across all teams. 
Over the last couple of years, observability has moved beyond the uptime and availability of APIs and includes the business. metrics that teams will need to be successful. 
API observability goes beyond just the technical observability of APIs and covers the metrics, reporting, and other aspects of operations that will matter to business stakeholders.
