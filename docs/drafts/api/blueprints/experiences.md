## Experiences 
The days of delivering technology for the sake of technology is over, and APIs need to be driving meaningful business experiences for consumers, otherwise, they will move on and look for what they need elsewhere. 

### Elements 
Providers who are further along in their API-first transformation have teams who are proficient in developing and maintaining digital resource APIs, and are rapidly delivering the meaningful and composable digital capabilities that power the business. Examining the digital experiences powered by APIs enables you to effectively map your APIs to real-world experiences. 

- **Discovery** - The ability to find APIs when new applications and integrations are being developed, or maybe a new API is being developed to ensure a version of it doesn~t already exist, at run time as part of a service mesh, or just randomly introducing people to the APIs that exist within an industry or organization. 
- **Evaluation** - Each digital experience should be easy to test, requiring minimal gates to step through to understand its value. The more you make your experiences available for consumers to evaluate, the more you will learn from them. 
- **Success** - Defining what success means for each digital experience helps make APIs much more effective. Having a clear understanding of successful outcomes will help reduce the surface area of each API that is used to shape experiences. 
- **Effort** - As an API producer and provider of digital experiences, it is important that you empathize with the effort you require from your consumers. Understanding this effort will help you develop empathy and optimize the experience. 
- **Seamlessness** - Digital experiences should always integrate with and augment existing consumer experiences, requiring as little from consumers as possible. Once value and trust have been established, you can evolve the experiences while remaining integrated. 
- **Awareness** - Effective digital experiences help build awareness amongst consumers, informing and educating them incrementally. Awareness is about investing in your consumers and working to build trust via a useful digital experience. 
- **Engagement** - The relationship between API producer and consumer, defining the number of ways in which they can engage synchronously and asynchronously, helping provide a rich feedback loop that ensures consumers have what they need, but producers have the insight they need to move forward as part of API operations. 
- **Iteration** - Experiences should adapt and evolve based upon the availability of new resources and composable capabilities. Digital experiences should reflect ongoing needs and desires of consumers, shaping what comes next. 
Most important of all, digital experiences provided by APIs have to be pleasant and beneficial. Making an experience memorable and leaving a positive mark on the consumer is what the API-first transformation is all about. The aim is making your API products fit consumer needs.

Digital experiences represent a more mature API economy, one where we are beginning to get sophisticated with technology, but are also improving our understanding of how and why we are doing APIs. That will help us bring digital products closer to meeting consumer needs while keeping them aligned with overall business goals, evolving and changing to suit both as circumstances dictate.
