## Education 
Providing ongoing education across teams is essential to enabling individuals to do the right thing when producing and consuming APIs. Making sure API operations is well documented is always the place to begin when it comes to API education and training, but then also working to make API operations as repeatable, and with guard rails as is possible. Providing as much in-person and virtual training via workshops covering all aspects of API operations. 

### Elements 
These are the elements of education. 

- **Workspaces** - A virtual space for doing API work, providing a location that has a name, description, and private, team, partner, or public visibility, where work on APIs, collections, mock servers, environments, monitors, and other elements of API operations can exist, providing a single location for API producers and consumers to engage across the API lifecycle, and move APIs forward in a collaborative way. 
- **Repositories** - Education about the API life cycle will have to be layered on top of your existing software development lifecycle. You can leverage ( repositories, README, and other common elements to introduce learning opportunities.
 
- **Documentation** - Documentation published as human consumable HTML pages help potential API consumers learn about what an API does by describing the paths, channels, parameters, headers, schema, messages, and other building blocks of APIs, showing examples of what is possible or by providing an API client to make calls to each API as part of the documentation. 
- **Guidelines** - Formal documentation, wikis, or other documents define your governance and enable teams to do the right thing as part of their work. 
- **Blueprints** - Stabilize common practices, distilling processes into simple blueprints to outline essential concepts teams will need to be successful. Establish a common vocabulary and set of practices across teams. 
- **Workshops** - Conduct virtual and in-person workshops whenever possible, providing training for every part of API operations. Derive your curriculum from your wider API strategy, equipping different job roles with what they need to contribute to operations.
