## Postman Sandbox 
Postman provides JavaScript APIs that you can use in your request scripts. The pm object provides functionality for testing your request and response data, with the postman object providing additional workflow control. 

### Elements 
These are the elements of the Postman Sandbox which is used as part of collections and automation. 

- **API** -  
- **Events** - Meaningful occurrences across business operations that trigger notifications or make calls to other APIs when resources are added, updated, deleted, viewed, or other action is taken with an individual API or the operations surrounding the API, making activity across API operations more interactive, dynamic, and alive. 
- **Repository** - A virtual container often associated with source control solutions used to start code, artifacts, and other objects associated with producing and consuming of APIs, building on existing software development practices to make the development and delivery of APIs across operations more collaborative, reliable, and consistent across domains, and teams. 
- **Documentation** - Documentation published as human consumable HTML pages help potential API consumers learn about what an API does by describing the paths, channels, parameters, headers, schema, messages, and other building blocks of APIs, showing examples of what is possible or by providing an API client to make calls to each API as part of the documentation.
