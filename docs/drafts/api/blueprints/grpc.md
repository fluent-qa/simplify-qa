## gRPC 
gRPC is an open-source, high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment, efficiently connecting services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is a solution for delivering industrial-grade distributed computing to devices, mobile applications, and browsers to backend services. Right out of the box, gRPC brings numerous benefits to your operations and your approach to delivering APIs. 

### Elements 
 

- **HTTP/2** - HTTP/2 is the next iteration of the HTTP protocol.Derived from the SPDY protocol developed by Google, it has been the preferred choice of transport for gRPC, though that will likely shift to HTTP/3 now that it is becoming ready for prime time. 
- **Protocol Buffers** - gRPC uses Protocol buffers, Googleâ€™s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data, to help deliver extremely efficient API resources for use in a variety of applications. 
- **Performance** - gRPC is known for being very performant, leveraging the latest protocols and serialization approaches to ensure that APIs function as the high-speed backbone for internal and B2B systems across any business domain. 
- **Code Generation** - With gRPC, you get a variety of client code out of the box in all of the top languages, providing high-quality code for developers to use in developing their applications using the industrial-grade API pattern.
 
- **Strict** - gRPC makes it difficult to deliver sloppily-designed APIs, providing a strict approach to defining the contracts that govern API producers
and consumers. That helps stabilize the APIs we depend upon across the enterprise so we can offer reliable services. 
- **Streaming** - Like WebSocket and other real-time APIs, gRPC streams data, providing an always-on connection for applications to use when sending or receiving high volumes of data as it is created, published, and made available via APIs. 
- **Robust** - gRPC is your backbone API infrastructure, providing what you need to connect your critical systems. It offers the performance and reliability you need for your most important, revenue-driving business operations.
 
- **Internal** - Internal - If you have the resources for it, using gRPC makes sense for powering your internal API infrastructure with some possible external partner instances. But mostly, gRPC should provide the API backbone you need to drive the core of your operations.
 
 
gRPC provides a very solid technical solution for delivering and maintaining infrastructure and backbone APIs within the enterprise and possibly with partner
and B2B solutions. gRPC is not an entry-level pattern like REST. While it can provide streaming APIs like WebSockets, gRPC is a much stricter and more disciplined approach to delivering API infrastructure, providing yet another solid pattern you can apply as part of your API-first transformation.
