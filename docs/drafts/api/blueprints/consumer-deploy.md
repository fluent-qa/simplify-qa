## Consumer - Deploy 
The deployment of API integrations comes in many shapes and sizes, and the notion of what an application is has shifted over time. Putting APIs to work used to be simply about web and mobile applications or system-to-system integrations. Today, deployment in the world of API consumers ranges from writing custom code for an application to low-code/no-code syncing between two separate API platforms. 

### Elements 
 

- **Source Control** - Place all manually developed or automatically generating client code in a repository, providing a source of truth for the code and for any artifacts that are needed to define the deployment and operation of any API integration. 
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Implement the continuous integration portion of CI/CD, automating how applications and integrations are deployed and, making the deployment of API integrations, applications, and other use cases something that is always repeatable. 
- **Collections** - Leverage a Postman collection as a modular, shareable, and executable definition of an application, stitching together many different API calls across internal and external API sources to apply digital resources and capabilities in a specific way. 
- **Serverless** - Use serverless layers for deploying integrations, orchestrations, and automating API resources and capabilities, tapping into ephemeral compute to deploy integration code that accomplishes specific business outcomes.
 
- **Runners** - Acknowledge that some collection applications will be manually
run by different team members using runners, organizing different types of integrations and applications by workspaces and letting different stakeholders manually put them to work. 
- **Monitors** - Schedule the run of collection-defined integrations. Use the collection, combined with environments that employ a variable strategy, to accomplish any API-driven applications and integrations on a schedule from any cloud region. 
- **Workflows** - Take advantage of complex workflows to put APIs to work, iterating through multiple series of API calls to enable business and technical stakeholders to design, save, and execute the scenarios they need to accomplish business each day. 
- **Webhooks** - Respond to different API events using webhooks to trigger collection- defined integrations, applications, and workflows. Engage with users via different platforms while responding to their activity using modular API deployments. 
 
To help todayâ€™s consumers deploy their API integrations, producers need to think beyond web and mobile apps. Make deployment across a spectrum of possibilities a simple, one-click affair, using minimal code.
