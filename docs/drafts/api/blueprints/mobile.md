## Mobile 
Mobile phones have been around since the 20th century, but in 2007 everything changed with the introduction of the Apple iPhone. These new mobile devices popularized a new category of Internet-connected applications we carry in our pockets, requiring an entirely new set of digital resources and unlocking an unlimited realm of possibilities and internet-enabled digital capabilities. 

### Devices 
Many types of mobile devices and operating systems have emerged in the last couple of decades, but the iPhone from Apple and Android OS continue to dominate the mobile landscape. 

- **iPhone** - In 2007, Apple forever changed how we build software with the introduction of the iPhone, which also introduced the mobile application ecosystem we now take for granted. This new system changed the way businesses make digital resources available. 
- **Android** - Following Appleâ€™s lead, in 2008, Google launched the Android mobile phone operating system. Eventually, this open-source software became the preferred OS for all handheld devices. 
 
### Digital resources 
After early mobile application developers realized they could deliver digital resources on mobile applications, waves of API providers emerged to provide the essential digital resources to power the growing spectrum of mobile applications. A few of many examples include: 

- **Twilio (SMS)** - Twilio made it simple to send and receive SMS messages using a well-defined web API. 
- **SendGrid (Email)** - SendGrid puts enterprise-grade email within reach of fast- growing startups. 
- **Stripe (Payments)** - Stripe abstracted away the complexities of the payment system using APIs. 
- **Google Maps (Payments)** - Google provided an API modeled after the hacks its own developers were using to create maps. 
- **YouTube (Videos)** - Youtube conquered the web using APIs to allow users to embed their videos. 
- **Instagram (Images)** - Instagram used APIs to bring images to mobile devices. 
- **WhatsApp (Messaging)** - WhatsApp modernized global communication using
simple APIs. 
Our personal and professional lives have become increasingly defined by the APIs that power our mobile applications, link us to global markets and news, and connect us to our family and friends.
