## Internet of Things (IoT) 
Once it was discovered that simple, low-cost web APIs would work for low-latency mobile applications, developers began using the same approach for sending messages and data between common everyday objects. APIs began connecting devices across our personal and professional lives, bringing the online world into the physical world and helping to automate and optimize how we do business. 

### Industries 
 

- **Manufacturing** - APIs are reshaping the manufacturing supply chain, linking the physical world with the digital world and moving the factory floor into the clouds. Processes are becoming more elastic, helping manufacturers keep up s online and offline, no matter where business is happening. 
- **Transportation** - Our cars, roads, and transit systems are being transformed through APIs, changing our experience as we commute to work and take trips with the family. Our lives have become more connected, no matter where we are. 
- **Energy** - APIs are modernizing our energy grid, digitizing monitoring and other processes to deliver the energy we need to live to our homes and businesses. 
- **Retail** - Commerce has moved online in the last 20 years, and the internet has crept into the physical, point-of-sale retail experience. Now the physical experience is becoming embedded with digital signage, sensors, cameras, and other connected devices to help shoppers find what they want and allow retailers to track their habits and purchases. 
- **Cities** - Our cities are being connected to the internet, bringing streets, parks, and public spaces online. Services can be improved by connecting the physical world to the cyber world, thanks to the APIs that stitch everything together. 
- **Healthcare** - Healthcare interoperability is a priority for hospitals, and public health agencies depend on APIs to bring the patient experience into the modern age, making sure healthcare records are available wherever they are needed. 
- **Agriculture** - As we work to feed growing populations, the agriculture industry is undergoing a wave of digitization. Whether they are used by drones, sensors, tractors, or the food distribution network, APIs are being applied in new and compelling ways to change how we grow and supply food.
