## Product Management 
API product management is the business and human bridge between API producers and consumers, providing a scaffolding to hang your APIs on that you are treating like products, but also making sure you are approaching the API lifecycle with an empathy for your API consumers, and delivering an experience that speaks to their worlds, while also being in alignment with your overall business goals. Creating and shaping the market for APIs, having a plan for how you are moving forward, and making sure you are measuring and reporting on the right things as  you engage with consumers on this ongoing API journey you are both on.
