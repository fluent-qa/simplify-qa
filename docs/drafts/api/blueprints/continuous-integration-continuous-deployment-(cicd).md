## Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) 
Tapping into continuous integration and continuous deployment, better known as CI/ CD, will help you build, test, and automate integrations with internal and external APIs, and also deploy APIs that can be used for applications and integrations. CI/CD allows you to leverage the native pipelines of your source control–or add a commercial or open source CI/CD solution, seamlessly tying API production and consumption with the repeatability you need across teams. 

### Elements 
 

- **Pipeline** - Use CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the API lifecycle is always repeatable and builds the highest-quality APIs possible Your pipeline provides a consistent build process for the deployment of each API you deliver. 
- **Variables** - Tap into a life cycle-wide strategy for defining variables applied as part of the pipeline build process, ensure that the naming, use, and evolution of these variables occurs at the strategic level, and that they are applied consistently at the CI/CD level. 
- **Collections** - Run contract, performance, security, and other types of collections as part of your pipeline using open source Newman. That way, you will be standardizing and validating as your APIs are built, applying a variety of tests, rules, and policies to improve quality.
 
- **Environments** - Use standardized guidance to provide teams the development, staging, and production environments they need, keeping CI/ CD pipelines alongside collections to ensure that each environment is well- defined as you feed the pipelines. 
- **Observability** - Tap into existing outputs for your CI/CD pipelines and for piping data into your API platforms, APM, and other observability and reporting systems. That will provide visibility for the testing that occurs as teams build APIs.
 
 
A modern API life cycle is built on top of existing enterprise investment through continuous integration and continuous deployment processes. You layer in common artifacts like OpenAPI, collections, and environments to ensure quality while maintaining velocity across operations.
CI/CD pipelines are the way to automate the API life cycle, using collections to execute contract, performance, security, and other types of tests. CI/CD pipelines are also
ripe for automating every other stop along the API life cycle–such as publishing documentation to a portal, applying policies at the gateway layer, and injecting governance into the build process across teams.

Of course, you can test your APIs at the CI/CD layer. But what teams need to realize is that this same testing can be applied not only to the instance of an API, but also to the operations around it.
