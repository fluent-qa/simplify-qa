## Protocols 
There are a variety of Internet protocols that are in use across the World Wide Web, regional, and local area networks, providing well-known protocols for transporting digital resources and capabilities around the globe in service of digital commerce. The most well-known protocol is the hypertext transfer protocol, or HTTP, which is the backbone of the web we know today, but HTTP is getting a makeover, as well as regular use of other leading protocols across the API landscape. 

### Protocols 
Various internet protocols are in use across the World Wide Web, allowing regional
and local area networks to transport digital resources and capabilities around the
globe to service digital commerce. The most well-known l is the hypertext transfer protocol, or HTTP, which is the backbone of the web as we know it., But HTTP is getting a makeover, and other leading protocols are also gaining acceptance across the API landscape. 

- **HTTP 1.1** - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is a protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless protocol that can be used for many tasks involved in distributed object management systems. 
- **HTTP/2** - HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol. It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol originally developed by Google, then adopted by the HTTP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. 
- **HTTP/3** - HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to exchange information on the World Wide Web, alongside HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. HTTP/3 always runs over QUIC, providing a next- generation internet approach. 
- **TCP** - The Transmission Control Protocol is one of the main protocols of the internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation, in which it complemented the Internet Protocol. Therefore the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. 
- **MQTT** - MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. The protocol usually runs over TCP/ IP; however, any network protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi- directional connections can support it. 
The protocol you select when delivering an API will set the tone with consumers for what is possible and will provide constraints depending on the patterns employed. This will determine what is possible across the API lifecycle, shaping your overall journey and business outcomes.
APIs, whether internal or external, are built on these fundamental internet protocols. APIs are the next iteration of the web and take advantage of the low cost of internet infrastructure to stitch together the digital experiences we plan when defining and shaping our businesses.
HTTP 1.1 provided us with the base we needed to get through the last 25-plus years of doing business on the web. HTTP/3 will be the protocol that delivers the future, with TCP and MQTT continuing to deliver the industrial-grade networks we need for the enterprise applications, systems, and devices that define our physical and digital supply chains. These protocols provide us with the transport layer we need to power our digital businesses, but there are other contracts and patterns weâ€™ll also need to get the job done.
