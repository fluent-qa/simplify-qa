## Application Performance Management (APM) 
As part of the API-first transformation, organizations look to existing APM solutions to monitor and manage the performance of APIs and the infrastructure and operations around them. All outputs from every stage of a well-defined API life cycle – and the software development lifecycle beneath it–are fed into existing APM solutions. This approach leaves no part of API operations untapped when it comes to detecting and diagnosing the performance and quality of API operations. 

### Elements 
 

- **Collections** - Postman collections are the modular, shareable, and executable way of defining the outputs across API operations. Collections make any platform more observable, allowing any aspect of API operations to be measured and evaluated. 
- **Environments** - Machine-readable environments define the common elements of API environments, including URLs, tokens, keys, and other variables that can be applied in a variety of settings, providing an efficient way to make APIs more observable. 
- **Operations** - You can define collections for the operations behind APIs, making source control, CI/CD, gateways, and other stops along the API life cycle observable. You can use collections to define the output, and a monitor to publish into the APM solution. 
- **Coverage** - You can standardize the coverage of tests for contract, performance, security, operations, and governance by using collections and scheduling with monitors. That provides you as close to 100% coverage across APIs as possible, ensuring that every part of operations is observable. 
- **Monitors** - Monitors are cloud collection runners that can be scheduled and run in different cloud environments. A variety of configurations is possible, allowing you to automatically monitor any aspect of API operations. 
- **Results** - The results from collection runs against different environments can be routed into common APM solutions, making the health data of APIs and operations available for further processing. Data can also be included in observability dashboards. 
- **Dashboards** - APM solutions make not only individual APIs, but the infrastructure around them more observable.That means you can view source control, CI/CD, and gateways in ways that make more sense to your business. 
 
Your APM solution is the observability window across your APIs and your operations. Every output from your API operations should route into your APM to provide you with a dashboard view of all the technical details surrounding your APM management. It also supplies your product managers and leaders with the view they need. Your APM is key to understanding the state of your enterprise. Use it to build the awareness you will need.
