## Platform-level Automation 
It is impossible for humans to keep up with the pace of today’s API operations. That means organizations need to make an ever-increasing investment in automating all the API operations behind our web, mobile, and device applications. Luckily, there is a very modular, collaborative, and executable way of automating API operations across teams. You can provide whatever unit of automation needed to define and execute anything across operations that can be done through an API. 

### Elements 
 

- **Collections** - Postman collections provide a modular, portable, and executable unit of value that can be applied across every stop along the API life cycle, defining individual API requests or workflows from multiple API requests that can be automated. 
- **Environments** - Machine-readable environments provide a well-planned set of variables that define development, staging, sandbox, and production environments, helping standardize automation so it can be applied across multiple potential environments. 
- **Runners** - Collection runners allow teams to run collections. They can see each step run, display results, and iterate through different business workflows. You can automate common tasks technical or business stakeholders can run. 
- **Pipeline** - CI/CD pipelines allow you to automate using APIs, beginning with testing, security, and governance as part of deployment and integration, and also providing any other automation workflow that needs to be accomplished upon a pipeline run. 
- **Newman** - Postman Newman provides an open-source command line runner that can run collections locally via the CLI, but also in CI/CD and cloud environments. It provides an engine for API automation that can run collections anytime in any environment. 
- **Monitors** - Collections can be automated on a schedule, running ongoing workflows across regions, different environments, and other configurations. Collection-driven automation helps you not only monitor, but execute business capabilities. 
 
Automation is the only way we will keep up with the future. It is essential to shift automation left across API teams while still empowering consumers. Automation enables both API producers and consumers to do more with less and keep up with today’s fast pace of business.

All API infrastructure should have APIs. API requests can be defined as very fine- grained or coarse-grained collections. The collections can be manually run with runners and scheduled via cloud monitors and CI/CD pipelines. Collections provide an unprecedented opportunity for defining all the knobs and levers you need to pull APIs forward throughout the API life cycle as executable and automatable units of value.

Every stage of the API life cycle should be automated, pushing well beyond test automation. The same kinds of automation you employ across the third-party APIs you depend on to do business, you can also apply to automating your own API operations. Automation is the only way we are going to be able to scale our businesses to meet the demands of a global digital marketplace. It allows teams to do more with fewer resources and focus on what they do best, automating the rest.
