## Source Control 
To move the organization forward along an API-first path, start by leveraging your existing source control for tracking and managing changes to code, and include the machine-readable artifacts you produce across the modern API life cycle.

Source control is key to managing collaboration among stakeholders and consumers across the multiple versions of an API that might be in production at any given moment. Source control allows us to extend the existing software development lifecycle to deliver and govern each API across a well-known API life cycle. 

### Elements 
 

- **Organizations** - Establish organizations for source control that are in alignment with your enterprise-wide API strategy. Align domains, groups, and organizations to facilitate the enablement of teams delivering and operating APIs. 
- **Repositories** - Make sure you have a clear mono or distributed repository strategy for the API life cycle. That will provide a source of truth to guide r team decisions about how source control repositories should be used to support APIs. 
- **Folders** -  Include in your API strategy guidance instructions about how folders within source control should be structured and used to consistently organize code and artifacts. That will give you a consistent approach for learning what is needed across many repositories. 
- **Artifacts** - Make sure essential machine-readable artifacts–such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and other contracts–are available across the API and software development lifecycle for use in documentation, testing, and much more. 
- **Feedback** -  Leverage source control feedback loops as part of the wider API life cycle feedback loop. Gather feedback from stakeholders throughout the evolution of code and artifacts, and ensure that feedback can be gathered at all stages of the life cycle. 
- **Integration** - Seamlessly integrate your source control into all aspects of the API life cycle, using Git or APIs to make your source control central where the API work is happening. Do not neglect to invest in the GitOps portion of your API factory floor. 
- **Automation** - Put automation to work, ensuring that your evolving code and artifacts for producing or consuming APIs is as standardized and repeatable as it can be. That will allow teams to do more with less while achieving high levels of quality. 
 
Git repositories can be aligned with API workspaces, but they also provide a well-known and seamless relationship with workspaces. This relationship between repositories and workspaces helps ensure that API contracts, collections, and other artifacts are present not just throughout the API life cycle, but in the underlying software development life cycle, enhancing the way your teams work.
