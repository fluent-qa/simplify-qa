## Gateway Contracts 
One of the most defining characteristics of next-generation or at least progressive gateways is the way that they have adopted API contracts. The ones who are not further along in their journey are using OpenAPI to simply publish documentation or power other platform capabilities. Where those who have embraced the following specifications as contracts or configurations at the runtime level across multiple protocols are further along in their journey. 

### Contracts 
These are the contracts governing gateway operation. 

- **OpenAPI** - Needs a description. 
- **AsyncAPI** - Needs a description. 
- **JSON Schema** - Needs a description. 
- **Protocol Buffers** - Needs a description. 
- **Avro** - Needs a description. 
- **Thrift** - Needs a description. 
- **Spectral** - Needs a description. 
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** - Needs a description. 
- **Extensions** - Needs a description. 
They perform a variety of functions as part of the operation. 
For me this layer is separate from any specific platform capability as well as the programmability of the gateway and is more about providing a declarative interface for each API, covering not just the design of the API, but also all of the policies and configuration of the gateway, shaping both upstream and downstream behavior.
