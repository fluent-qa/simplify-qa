## Products 
Treating each of your APIs as an individual product, viewing consumers as customers that are part of an ongoing feedback loop around the value an API generates, and what the road map will involve, striking a balance between what producers and consumers need when it comes to business use cases. 

### Product Characteristics 
Treating APIs as products means doing the hard work to establish user empathy and ensure that theyâ€™re easy to use and possess the shortest possible time-to-value. Good API products provide a complete API experience, with quality documentation, feedback loops, and support channels that give you the insights you need to iterate upon each new API version, helping to ensure that every release meets the needs of the widest possible audience. 

- **Consumer-Centered** - Make sure that the design, development, and operation of your APIs is as consumer-centered as possible. 
- **Experience** - Your API operations should focus on creating the most meaningful experience possible for your consumers, transcending the resources and capabilities being offered. 
- **Use Cases** - Make sure that your APIs are designed for specific business use cases that matter to your consumers. Make a commitment to understanding their processes. 
- **Feedback Loops** -  Invest in your feedback loops with consumers, making it as easy as possible for them to provide feedback you can use as a road map for future iterations. 
- **Value Generation** - Ensure that your APIs focus on generating value for your consumers as well as your platform. API operations must benefit both you and your consumers. 
- **Measurement** - Define your metrics, gather data, and use it to make sense of how your consumers are putting your APIs to work making the information part of the API life cycle. 
- **Revenue** - Have a clear strategy for how your APIs will generate or support revenue generation, justifying their existence along the way. 
- **Road Map** - Establish a road map on day one, and make sure you are keeping consumers informed of possible future developments to keep them along for the ride. 
Treating your APIs as products will lift you from merely creating applications that are technically good to delivering solutions that meet consumer needs. Each new version is a dance with consumers, requiring you to find the right balance, helping them while also meeting your business needs.
