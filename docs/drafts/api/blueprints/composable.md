## Composable 
Modern software is about composing, assembling, evolving, and decommissioning business resources and capabilities to meet the ever-changing needs of the enterprise. Today’s software not only allows us to build products, but to invent modular, industrial-grade Lego building blocks that power the web, mobile, and device applications we need to do business at the pace of the Internet. 

### Elements 
 

- **Resources** - Every digital resource produced and consumed by the enterprise is available for use somewhere. Mapping out all of the atoms of your digital transformation keeps the business in line with what it needs to operate and compete globally in a digital landscape. 
- **Capabilities** - Essential workflows and algorithms are defined in detail through many private, partner, and public APIs. These APIs document what the enterprise is capable of at any moment, while also being ready to adapt, change, and respond to entirely new market needs. 
- **Modular** - Enterprise resources and capabilities should be as modular as possible, driving re-use and collectively applying them at scale. You need to reduce business value down to the smallest reliable form, then make it available as a product to consumers via APIs. 
- **Distributed** - The enterprise is distributed geographically and organizationally, giving domains, groups, and teams the agency they need to deliver essential resources and capabilities while minimizing their dependency on other teams. 
- **Discoverable** - All the building blocks of the enterprise are discoverable, making digital resources and capabilities available to both business and technical stakeholders, as well as consumers. Everyone must have what they need to conduct business and compete. 
- **Self-Service** - Enterprise digital resources and capabilities are available via self-service and are visible only to intended audiences. Those who have access should be able to sign up and begin putting APIs to work with as few steps possible. 
- **Reliable** - Digital resources and capabilities must be reliable, providing users what they need without friction. Establishing and maintaining trust with consumers means reliably doing exactly what they need. 
- **Observable** - The ability to observe the usage of any digital resource or capability must be the default, no matter how many times something is reused and bundled with other services and no matter the scale of the deployment. 
 
Modern software is composable because APIs exist just beneath the surface. APIs are how massive enterprise operations are made composable, reusable, and scalable. They do the hard work of reshaping the enterprise, using and re-using resources to provide the greatest business value possible.
A composable enterprise is the goal of an API-first transformation because this is where new revenue streams will emerge.APIs provide the agility and flexibility enterprises will need to compete and get ahead in today’s digital marketplace. Composability is quickly becoming an essential enterprise trait.
Organizations further along in their API-first transformation journey will already have the digital resources, capabilities, processes, and practices in place to become agile and composable. The rest must internalize APIs in ways that will allow them to catch up.
