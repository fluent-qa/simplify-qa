## Team Profile 
The public-facing profile for a team, offering up a landing page for users in the Postman API network. 

### New Accounts 
These are the elements that make up any team profile. 

- **Join Existing Team** - If you sign up with your organization email and your company has a Postman account with team discovery enabled, you will see teams you can join. Anyone with the same domain can request to join an existing team. 
- **Create Team** - To create a team and optionally invite collaborators, enter a team name and URL. 
 
### Existing Accounts 
You can also create or join a new team if you already have an individual Postman account. 

- **Create Team** - Set up a free team for up to three people under your avatar in the top right corner. You will need to enter a team name and URL, and then invite people to your team. Also, if you create a team workspace without already being a member of a team, a new team will automatically be created for you. 
- **Paid Team** - If you have a free account, you can upgrade to a paid plan, and then invite people to your team. 
- **Consolidating Teams** - If you already belong on a team (or several), you may decide to join forces with one or more Postman teams. There are multiple methods of migrating your data into a single team. 
 
### Invitations 
You can be invited to a team, joining a separate team from the ones you are already part of. 

- **Existing Account** - Each account can be on one Postman team at a time. If you want to join a team using an existing account that is already part of a team, you will need to leave behind your old team (see details in the following section). 
- **New Account** -  If you want to use the same email address to sign up for a new account, you can create a new alias with your existing email by using the + (plus) sign as a prefix separator. For example, emails sent to joyce@postman.com and joyce+test@postman.com deliver to joyce@postman.com. You can create a separate account for each team you join, and switch between multiple accounts. 
- **SSO** - If your Postman team is on the Business or Enterprise plan and enabled Single Sign-On, log in with your configured Identity Provider. 
 
### Profile 
You can craft your team profile to match what you are up to. 

- **Name** - “Name” here means the name of the linting rule, describing what it applies to and how it makes the design of an API or the operation around it more consistent. 
- **Domain** -  
- **Favicon** -  
- **Visibility** - The visibility of each API, whether it is private, partner, or public, should be deployed deliberately and confidently, making sure each API is available to consumers and striking a balance between access and control to meet desired business outcomes. 
- **Description** - A verbose description states what a rule does, providing as much detail as possible about how the rule standardizes one small part of operations, helping to stabilize teams. 
- **Website** -  
- **Twitter Username** -  
- **Github Username** -
