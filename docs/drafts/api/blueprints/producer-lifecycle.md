## Producer Lifecycle 
The view of a well-known lifecycle for delivering and iterating upon different types of APIs at different points in their evolution, describing the concerns that teams who are producing APIs will have, helping shine a light on one possible way to approach the ongoing development of APIs. 

### Stages 
These are the stages of a lifecycle for a producer, helping offer a standardized set of stages for consistently delivering APIs. 

- **Define** - Establishing the nature, scope, and meaning of some part of API operations, providing more details about the surface area of an API, or even the lifecycle around each API, providing primary or secondary data that can be used to understand the state and purpose of each API by a human or another machine. 
- **Design** - The functional shape, surface, and details of any type of an API provided in a way that can be collaborated around and shared with other stakeholders, providing a set of human and machine-readable instructions for what each API is able to do that demonstrates a great deal of thought has gone into its form and function. 
- **Develop** - The development of some part of APIs and the operations around them, working on something that is entirely new or improving on some existing part of the system by evolving the API or how it is operated, moving forward some part of the enterprise system in response to a new application or integration. 
- **Test** - null 
- **Secure** - Ensuring that an API is secure from threats and vulnerabilities, making for a pretty wide spectrum of different processes and technologies that ensure digital resources and capabilities made available via APIs are only accessible to an intended audience and bad actors are not able to find ways to get access via an API. 
- **Deploy** - Using an API gateway to deploy and manage APIs provides a single or federated approach to providing access to backend services using well-defined APIs, standardizing how APIs are published to development, staging, production, or other environments, while also consistently applying authentication, logging, and the other elements needed to properly manage APIs at scale. 
- **Observe** - View dashboards, reports, history, and logs to observe the state of a single API, the operations around it, and even across many different APIs and domains, taking advantage of the existing outputs that exist across operations to develop an awareness of API operations and how everything works. 
- **Distribute** -
