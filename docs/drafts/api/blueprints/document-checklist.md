## Document Checklist 
When properly defined, Postman collections provide a rich way to define shareable, portable, and embeddable documentation for APIs, moving API documentation out of the portal and making it available anywhere, designed to keep up with the pace of change across enterprise operations.

### Building Blocks 
These are the essential building blocks of API documentation. 

- **Name** - “Name” here means the name of the linting rule, describing what it applies to and how it makes the design of an API or the operation around it more consistent. 
- **Description** - A verbose description states what a rule does, providing as much detail as possible about how the rule standardizes one small part of operations, helping to stabilize teams. 
- **Folders** - Logical separators within a collection for organizing and sequencing API requests for browsing by humans, but also automating with a runner or as part of a CI/CD pipeline, helping organize reference API collections, choreograph automation, and orchestrations across many different APIs as part of a single collection. 
- **Getting Started** -  
- **Authentication** - The consistent application of standard authentication as part of a standardized API management layer strikes a balance between access to digital resources and ensuring that undesirable actors do not have access to valuable assets. 
- **Headers** - Key / Value pairs of data that can be passed back and forth as part of API requests, confirming to the HTTP standard, and relying on the IANA registry of headers to define and shape the routing and prioritization of requests being made to APIs when using HTTP as the transport protocol between client and server. 
- **Path Parameters** -  
- **Query Parameters** - The parameters available after an API path separated by a question mark, providing one or many individual key / value pairs that can be used to shape and define each API request being made, providing many different ways an API consumer can access data, content, media, and other digital resources or capabilities via a simple web API, leverage web technology to deliver useful APIs. 
- **Bodies** -  
- **Variables** - Key / value pairs of data that can be defined independently and stored within environments, but then applied across collections, providing variables that can be used for authentication, pagination, and other common aspects of working with APIs, allowing secrets to be abstracted away from each individual collection, but also other context that has little to do with the collection, or may define a state across multiple APIs and collections. 
- **Examples** - Examples of the API request, responses, and messages used across API operations helps provide a versioned, evolvable, and reusable set of example and synthetic data that can make documentation richer and testing more relevant to actual business needs. 
- **Errors** - Provide standardized and well-defined guidance for handling errors, ideally following Internet standards. 
- **Scripts** - Lightweight scripts that can be run as part of each API request, providing pre-request scripting, or post-request scripting that help appy business logic at either end of the request, helping transform, test, and automate with each API request. 
- **Visualizations** -  
- **Snippets** - You can generate lightweight code snippets in a variety of programming languages. They will do most of the heavy lifting for consumers integrating APIs in the language of their choice, automating the more repetitive aspects of API integration. 
 
### Distribution 
Where the documentation is available. 

- **Workspaces** - A virtual space for doing API work, providing a location that has a name, description, and private, team, partner, or public visibility, where work on APIs, collections, mock servers, environments, monitors, and other elements of API operations can exist, providing a single location for API producers and consumers to engage across the API lifecycle, and move APIs forward in a collaborative way. 
- **Portals** - An API deployed into production should be published to the central portal, providing centralized access for internal or external consumers through a single doorway that can be supported as part of overall API operations. 
- **Links** -  
- **Buttons** - The documentation, tests, and workspace behind an API should be made available via blog posts, videos, wikis, and other resources to support APIs. Use embeddable and actionable buttons that consumers can activate with one click. 
 
### Engagement 
The ways in which documentation is engaged with. 

- **Watches** - Keeping track of the watches on workspaces, APIs, and collections to understand who is tuned into what is happening. Use watches as a
metric for the number of consumers, contributors, and internal and external stakeholders who are tuned in. 
- **Forks** - Making a linked copy of an API, or the mocks, documentation, tests, and other areas of the lifecycle defined as a collection to another workspace, allowing anyone to run on their own, make changes and enhancements, then if they desire, contribute back to the original and receive regular updates over time. 
- **Comments** - Comments on APIs, collections and other elements of API operations allow for more tightly coupled and inline conversations to occur around entire elements or specific parts and pieces of elements, allowing teams to collaborate and communicate across the API lifecycle. 
- **Headers** - Key / Value pairs of data that can be passed back and forth as part of API requests, confirming to the HTTP standard, and relying on the IANA registry of headers to define and shape the routing and prioritization of requests being made to APIs when using HTTP as the transport protocol between client and server.
