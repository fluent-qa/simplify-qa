## Ad Hoc Landscape 
In the fast-paced enterprise business environment, there is a never-ending attraction towards defining digital resources and capabilities as one-offs to support specific projects, applications, and integrations. That leaves you with a legacy trail of APIs that are often redundant, overlapping, and in need of investment to remain reliable and continue delivering value for the business. 

### Common distractions for API operations 
There are plenty of distractions that cause organizations to lose their way of delivering, sustaining, and evolving their API landscape. Identifying common distractions is the first step in elevating your APIs into a single strategy that can move operations forward. 

- **One Project** - It is easy to see APIs as a subset of a project with clear start
and completion dates, rather than part of a larger enterprise system and something that should be discoverable and usable beyond the project at hand. 
- **One Application** - The needs of a specific web or mobile application are often prioritized over the larger enterprise system, resulting in redundant or shadow APIs, which are invisible because they are obfuscated by apps. 
- **One Partner** - It is common to feel the need to respond to partner requests individually rather than seeing them as part of a larger system, resulting in unnecessary repetitive work. Defining a standardized set of partner resources would help speed up interactions. 
- **One Integration** - Integrations between two internal or external systems often end up as one-off solutions, contributing to an ad hoc landscape rather than a ready-to-go integration toolbox for all business needs. 
- **One Customer** - Some customers are louder than others and may enjoy an outsized role in decisions, resulting in APIs that do not serve the wider needs of a customer base. They also lead to an ad hoc API business landscape and more overhead.
 
 
In the moment, each potential distraction might seem like a priority. Teams will be incentivized to deliver the project, application, or integration that meets the specific needs of a partner or a customer, resulting in redundancies and inefficiencies across operations. But with a centralized API strategy and well-defined API lifecycle and governance structures in place, your APIs can collectively be harnessed as part of the wider enterprise, with fewer distractions along the way.
