## Using APIs Across Many Types of Applications 
APIs deliver resources and digital capabilities across multiple types of applications, powering many different web, mobile, and device services, as well as providing system-
to-system integrations and automations. The way enterprises see applications and integrations begins to evolve once they begin shifting towards API-first operations, pushing the boundaries of what applications mean and how they become part of business operations. 

### Types 
APIs have powered applications since the beginning of computers. The current breed of web APIs found its roots in aggregating content for web applications, then quickly expanded to mobile devices, back to the desktop, and even to the network beneath our applications. 

- **Desktop** - APIs are how desktop applications on our Windows and Mac PCs exchange data with the server, making hundreds or thousands of calls each day to create, read, update, and delete information as needed. 
- **Web** - Websites began as simple HTML documents, but have become a dynamic mix of many internal and external API calls. These are stitched together to provide the desired online experience within a specific domain, providing a richer web experience than was possible before. 
- **Mobile** - Mobile phones allow websites and applications to be accessible in our hands, turning a device for voice or messaging into a rich application ecosystem that sends and receives data across many different cloud platforms. 
- **Device** - Once developers realized that APIs could power mobile applications, they moved on to making internet-enabled televisions, thermostats, automobiles, and other IoT products. 
- **Network** - As more of the infrastructure we depend on for the web moved to the clouds, the network connecting servers and clients has also become API- enabled, making the network composable and configurable and changing how we operate applications.
