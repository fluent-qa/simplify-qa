## Regions 
Enterprises are increasingly deploying APIs across multiple geographic regions to move digital resources and capabilities closer to customers and comply with regulatory and data sovereignty requirements. As physical borders evolve to become digital borders, organizations have many new considerations as they expand their operations.
 

### Elements 
 

- **Deployments** - API producers are increasingly deploying their APIs into multiple regions, and must ensure that gateways to backend systems meet customer and regulatory needs in specific geographies. 
- **Availability** - Some enterprises are only offering a portion of their digital resources, capabilities, and experiences to specific regions. They are designing and delivering APIs based upon what different regions need. 
- **Operations** - Organizations are zooming out from individual APIs and thinking about their overall operational needs. That could mean full deployment of APIs, or making only part of the catalog available to specific regions, depending on the broader scope of business needs. 
- **Revenue** - Invest in the research to understand the revenue opportunities you would gain by delivering APIs to a specific region. Work to understand the needs of target consumers, then provide an initial set of APIs to meet their needs. 
- **Governance** - It is important to build into your governance strategy some consideration of regional needs; that is, the f rules, policies, and other standardization you will need to support each individual region. 
- **Legal** - Make sure you understand the legal requirements of operating in a specific region. Examine local laws, regulations, and the legal details of engaging with consumers. 
- **Health** - Dashboards will help you understand the regional health of your APIs, while also observing health across the enterprise. 
- **Support** - Before expanding to new regions, make sure you can support those operations. That means, providing multilingual and localized content, documentation, and any other resources your consumers will need for success. 
 
The World Wide Web is global, but in recent years network and data sovereignty concerns and nationalism have introduced more regulation that enterprises must consider when delivering r APIs in specific regions. While regulation is a top concern, the main driver for regional expansion is pushing resources, capabilities, and experiences closer to consumers to better meet their needs.
