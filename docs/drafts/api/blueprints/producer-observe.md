## Producer - Observe 
Observability provides teams with the ability to “see” APIs and the operations around them using a set of common metrics, helping provide the data needed to operate and move forward each API independently of others. 

### Elements 
 

- **Activity** - You must understand the activity across an API platform to understand how APIs are being moved forward, configured, and evolved over time by tapping infrastructure outputs, ensuring there is provenance for changes throughout the API lifecycle. 
- **Logs** - Actively use logs for source control, CI/CD, and the gateway. They provide the outputs you need to understand the velocity of individual APIs, as well as velocity across domains. Tap into existing logging outputs to observe the state of each API. 
- **Traces** - Leverage traces added to clients, SDKs, gateways, and other functions. They will help you make sense of the API landscape and how APIs are putting backend infrastructure to work, using unique identifiers that are passed to APIs and tracked all the way to backend systems.
 
- **Monitors** - Establish monitors for all contract, performance, security, and governance tests. These tests provide the results you need to understand the state of APIs and API operations. Use collections to define all of the outputs you need to understand the state of your APIs. 
- **Application Performance Management (APM)** - Route all outputs across API operations into your existing APM solutions, tapping every output across the API life cycle to understand the health and state of the platform through the infrastructure you have already invested in. 
- **Dashboards** - Set up dashboards within your APM to understand the health of individual APIs and the life cycle around them, providing a visual way for anyone to observe the state of any API and how it is operated. 
- **Reports** - Provide team, API, documentation, testing, and other reporting, showing what teams are doing across API operations and how the lifecycle is unfolding across teams. Use native platform reporting that speaks specifically to API operations. 
- **Notifications** - Use notifications and alerts to observe changes with each API, as well as events that occur across the life cycle. They will help you understand consumer activity, as well as what is happening across teams and other stakeholders. 
 
Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. You need to tap into all the existing outputs available across the API platform and the infrastructure used to move APIs forward across the API life cycle into production.

Because our infrastructure has APIs, we can use collections to define each aspect of API operations as a machine-readable, executable, and granular output that routes data into our APM solutions. That helps make 100% observability an achievable goal for your teams.
