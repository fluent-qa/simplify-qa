## Gateway Integrations 
APIs provide an opportunity for deep integration with existing API gateway solutions across the API lifecycle, allowing API contracts to be published and synced, rate limits, logging, caching, and other gateway capabilities to be configured and automated with as part of the API lifecycle. 

### Leading Enterprise Vendors 
While there are numerous other API gateways in the game, there are three distinct gateways that have shaped the conversation over the last decade, and while these are rarely the choice of developers when it comes to meeting their daily needs, there are plenty of three and five-year contracts actively in place, with these three gateways baked into enterprise operations. 

- **MuleSoft Anypoint Platform** - A strong sales legacy landing AnyPoint into the enterprise. 
- **Axway** - Axway isn’t a leader, but has managed to keep pace while still innovating. 
- **Apigee X** - While baked into the Google cloud, Apigee won the significant business to date. 
These three gateways represent the tip of what has been for the last decade when it comes to a very top-down approach to centralizing API publishing across the enterprise, which is still relevant today, but doesn’t reflect where enterprises are headed when it comes to iterating and increasing velocity as part of their API journey. 
### Cloud Vendors 
Around 2015, as the core capabilities of the API gateway began to be commoditized, it also began being baked into the cloud. Acquisitions were made by Microsoft and Google to develop their offering, and AWS got to work on their own homegrown solution to provide these capabilities that the enterprise were needing as a default part of their operations. 

- **Amazon Gateway** - Providing HTTP and Websocket capabilities across their regions. 
- **Azure API Management** - Weaving their API management acquisition into their CI/CD flows. 
- **Apigee X** - While baked into the Google cloud, Apigee won the significant business to date. 
API gateway capabilities being baked into the cloud changed the game and began breaking up the API management bundle, allowing newer startups to come in and compete with the legacy enterprise API management vendors, changing how we talk about gateways, and management, but also approach every stop along the API Lifecycle. 
### Current Leaders 
As the slow wheels of the machine consumed the API gateway and were baking into the clouds, teams embarked on their microservices evolution, and mainstream business began waking up to the API-First Transformation a new, much smaller version of the API gateway emerged to provide developers with what they needed on the ground. 

- **Kong** - Worked very hard to become the poster child for what developers need with a gateway. 
- **NGINX Plus** - Repackaging up an essential web server and proxy to behave like a gateway. 
- **Tyk** - Building a new solution from the ground up to meet the needs of developers and leadership. 
These gateways have worked to meet the needs of developers who were ignored while enterprise leadership made their purchasing decisions with the older guard of API management solutions, meeting the specific needs you have when publishing internal and external APIs while avoiding the bloat that came with catering to the entire API Lifecycle.
