## Gateways 
No more can a single vendor control access to all internal resources and capabilities. Today’s multi-gateway landscape possesses a range of characteristics suitable for different needs and outcomes, reflecting the ever-expanding demands consumers are placing on internal and external APIs. 

### Elements 
 

- **Centralized** - Many enterprises have a single centralized gateway handling all traffic coming from outside the enterprise via a single entry point. That provides an industrial-grade way of handling traffic coming in and out of the enterprise. 
- **Federated** - It is increasingly common for enterprises to support a federated gateway approach for making APIs available across domains, acquisitions, and lines of business, and helping to manage traffic in and out of the sprawling enterprise landscape. 
- **Regional** - The deployment of regionally specific gateways has emerged to respond to increased regulation and data sovereignty rules in many regions. Regional gateways also bring resources and capabilities closer to the consumer. 
- **Vendors** - It is common for enterprise organizations to have API gateways from multiple vendors, providing a mix of gateway solutions teams can use when securing APIs or managing the access to digital resources and capabilities within a specific cloud. 
- **Cloud** - Many enterprises now use multiple clouds, leading teams to runcloud- specific gateways. That means teams need to learn specific approaches for publishing cloud- native APIs. 
- **Open** - Open-licensed gateways, as well as openly licensed contracts, policies, and other artifacts, are increasingly common in enterprises, providing a low-cost and interoperable approach to managing gateway APIs. 
 
The gateway landscape today is farmore modular, distributed, and standards-driven than it was just a decade ago. API gateway offerings continue to evolve to meet an increasingly diverse landscape of protocols, patterns, and network considerations.
These API gateway characteristics aren’t just exposing APIs, they are helping us
ensure that our APIs are available where and how consumers need them. These elements reflect the needs of the modern enterprise for delivering the digital resources, capabilities, and experiences they need to move at the pace of today’s global operations. Today’s API gateway has shape-shifted to reflect what teams need for navigating a sprawling enterprise landscape.
