## Syncing Your Specs with Collections 
Many teams use an API specification, such as OpenAPI, to describe the long-term relationship between an API producer and potential API consumers. They can then use the OpenAPI to generate user documentation in the form of a collection. And then keep their collection and specification up to date as their API grows.

- **Internal** - Internal API portals exist as part of legacy investment in API management solutions. They often needmore work and engagement to ensure they are keeping pace with the rate of change. 
- **External** - Publicly available API portals are becoming a common fixture of enterprise public websites. They provide a public doorway to digital resources and capabilities available for use in business operations.
 
- **Network** - Networks provide an opportunity to connect your private, partner, and public APIs to a larger network of developers. That will help automate discovery not only of APIs, but of the mock servers, tests, and other aspects of API operations. 
- **Documentation** - Human-readable API documentation has become a staple of portals, providing HTML views of what is possible with APIs. Documentation describes how to use them, providing examples that demonstrate potential and speak to developers. 
- **Onboarding** - Portals are the doorway to API consumption. They show consumers what is possible and how to get started putting APIs to work as part of applications and integrations.
 
- **Community** - One way to breathe more life into your API ecosystem is to build, attract, and cultivate community within your own API portal. You can also
link g to other networks to engage with developers in the communities they frequent. 
- **Support** - Providing support to API consumers offers a rich opportunity for building trust and ensuring they successfully put your APIs to use. 
- **Discovery** - A well-maintained portal provides a rich opportunity for helping producers and consumers discover new APIs when they want to develop new APIs of their own, plan new applications and integrations, or put resources to work. 
- **Experience** - Portals arenâ€™t just about providing documentation and support. They are about delivering meaningful and enjoyable experiences for consumers and making digital resources and capabilities more accessible for developers.
