## Capabilities 
A capability is a simple representation of something that can be accomplished digitally, defining a valuable process, workflow, model, or algorithm that is valuable to internal or external consumers. Often defined by one or many API requests or subscriptions that reflect a specific business capability, representing a single product offering, or bundling multiple capabilities together for a specific digital product experience. 

### Some Common Resources 

A digital capability is simply a representation of something that can be accomplished digitally, defining a process, workflow, model, or algorithm that is valuable to internal or external consumers. Digital capabilities are often defined by one or many API requests or subscriptions that reflect a specific business capability. They may represent a single product offering or bundle multiple capabilities together for a specific digital product experience. 

- **Flows** - A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information using API- defined resources. 
- **Actions** - Digital capabilities are designed to enable action of some sort, allowing online or offline processes to be triggered and setting additional workflows in motion. Actions also generate data along the way, producing intended outcomes across platforms or real-world devices. 
- **Events** - Organizations are increasingly defined by meaningful events that occur across internal and external operations. These events deliver the intended outcomes that business and technical leaders are looking for, allowing for the orchestration of the desired outcomes that matter most. 
- **Models** - Artificial Intelligence and machine learning models are developed, iterated upon, and applied in increasingly modular ways using APIs. That’s because APIs can access the data we have stored in databases and collected from daily operations and use it to iterate upon algorithms to make them more useful. 
It should be clear by now that enterprise digital capabilities are defined by APIs. Business is set in motion through automation and orchestration across the native and third-party digital capabilities that each organization has access to. Being API-first allows you to define all of the private and open processes you apply across operations in private, secure, and reliable ways.

Your business operations depend on the synchronous and asynchronous delivery of many processes, putting your native, partner, and third-party resources to work. APIs allow you to define all of the internal and external digital resources you depend on. Your digital capabilities allow you to orchestrate and automate with these resources.

The collective power of your enterprise capabilities across domains—and your ability to apply and iterate upon them based upon how they are used—define what you are capable of as an enterprise. The API-first transformation is realized when you are able to define, use, and evolve your enterprise digital capabilities with maturity and control. How well you execute these processes will determine just how capable your organization truly is.
