## Partnerships 
As more business is conducted online through partner SaaS applications and other external services, the urgency to make internal APIs available to partners has increased. The line between inside and outside the firewall is becoming blurred as making digital resources available to trusted external partners becomes a priority. 

### Elements 
 

- **Purpose** - You must offer partners a clear menu of enterprise resources and capabilities through APIs and self-service, making operations streamlined and repeatable across relationships.
 
- **Onboarding** - With APIs, you can reduce partner onboarding time from weeks or months to hours or days, automating the process as much as possible. That will reduce friction when qualifying partners and give them access faster. 
- **Access** - It is common to give early and exclusive access to API resources and capabilities to specific r groups of partners before you offer them to the general public. 
- **Innovation** - To incentivize partner innovation and provide preferred access to fuel the development of new and interesting products and services. Lean on partners to deliver applications, integration plugins, and other interesting business use cases. 
- **Exposure** - APIs in partnership scenarios expose your organization to new opportunities for responding to their needs in any situation.
 
- **Marketing** - The digital resources and capabilities made available via APIs provide what you need to develop effective marketing campaigns. Being API- first allows your teams to reach new levels of marketing automation and do more with less, generating a bigger impact. 
- **Branding** - There is an opportunity to extend your brand across external communities, leveraging APIs to aggregate content across social networks and push messages out through partner platforms. 
- **Communications** - Feedback loops are a natural part of modern API operations. Gathering feedback from partners informs the API roadmap, helping to drive business forward. 
 
Self-service APIs equipped with a well-defined onboarding process provide a proven way to securely connect businesses with partners, enabling synchronous and asynchronous digital transactions via APIs.
An organization-wide API strategy allows you to respond to partner needs without advance preparation. Investing in your API-first transformation supports partner relationships by making your digital resources and capabilities available to partners, allowing them to build the next generation of experiencesâ€”which in turn strengthens your own business.
