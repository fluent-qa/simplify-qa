## Versioning 
Having a plan for managing change in a consistent way across API operations, providing a semantic or date-based versioning framework for assigning and communicating the changes being made to an API over time, ensuring that all change will be deliberate and well communicated. 

### Elements 
These are some of the elements of versioning APIs, helping manage change across many different APIs and effectively communicate the forward motion with consumers. 

- **Semantic Versioning** - Applying a dotted notion for defining major, minor, and patch versions of an API, articulating the different between a breaking change, and non-breaking or fixes to an API for errors that may have be introduced via previous versions. Providing a very structured way for defining, but also communicating change occurring with each individual API. 
- **Date Versioning** -  
- **Path Versioning** -  
- **Header Versioning** -
