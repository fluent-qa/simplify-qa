## Expansion 
APIs are the building blocks of modern digital transformation. They provide the reusable, composable, and scalable units of value that are defining digital resources across every industry. APIs give us the ability to deploy and operate essential services across multiple clouds and multiple regions, allowing enterprises to redefine and rebuild their business in a much more resilient manner. APIs give us the digital capabilities we need to sustain the existing business, but also to define entirely new sectors we havenâ€™t yet imagined. 

### Elements 
 

- **Resources** - The enterprise has the required digital resources at its disposal for assembling the applications, integrations, and automation needed, but
it also has the API factory floor, giving it the capacity to deliver the next generation of resources.. APIs are the building blocks of any future world we want to create, allowing us to manifest the products we know markets will need.
 
- **Capabilities** - There are thousands of business workflows in motion across the enterprise at any given second. With APIs, they become discoverable, well-defined, and executable by business and technical stakeholders. That allows for the rapid creation, maturing, and scaling of known and unknown workflows that the enterprise will need to do business tomorrow. 
- **Scale** - Combined with the elasticity of the cloud, an API-first digital platform provides the scale required to build an entirely new world, providing an unlimited supply of digital resources and capabilities, as well as the teams to deliver new products. Products can be rapidly created, iterated upon, and then scaled to meet the demand of markets within weeks or even days, not years, providing the just-in-time scale needed to compete in a digital world. 
- **Multi-Cloud** - The next era of cloud computing will not be isolated in a single cloud. The enterprises that have achieved a world-building level of operations are finding success operating across all of the cloud platforms. They are investing in the talent, processes, and infrastructure needed to wrestle with the nuances of each cloud platform, but leveraging APIs to abstract away
the differences, allowing them to successfully operate in all of the top cloud providers whenever business demands it. 
- **Multi-Region** - API-first enterprises are applying their new-found API-first agility and velocity to stand up and operate API infrastructure in regions closest to their consumers. They are responding to regulation and data nationalism, but also reducing latency by operating closer to the edge of their business networks. APIs can help organizations define their operations by domain, but also by geographic region, optimizing the platform to provide a better consumer experience. 
- **Regulated** - An API platform lends itself to efficient management of highly regulated enterprises, responding to internal as well as external influences in a balanced way. Layering government regulation into a mix of governance tools gives leaders more control over how the enterprise responds to markets and regulators, while staying focused on the needs of consumers. The API platform pushes regulation to a state in which the enterprise has the ability to shape it as a positive force in how the company does business.
