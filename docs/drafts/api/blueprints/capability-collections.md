## Capability Collections 
A capability collection is a small single-use collection designed to accomplish a specific task, and represent a single capability of an API producer and the organization behind it. Providing a single well-documented API request that accomplishes a specific business objective, helping reduce the cognitive load when it comes to putting an API to work. 

### Elements 
 

- **Simple** - REST works as an API pattern because it is simple, making digital resources, capabilities, and experiences available to consumers in a way that can be discovered, understood, and put to use with the least amount of work possible.
 
- **Modular** - Enterprise resources and capabilities should be as modular as possible, driving re-use and collectively applying them at scale. You need to reduce business value down to the smallest reliable form, then make it available as a product to consumers via APIs. 
- **Do One Thing** -  
- **Do It Reliably** -  
- **Documentation** - Documentation published as human consumable HTML pages help potential API consumers learn about what an API does by describing the paths, channels, parameters, headers, schema, messages, and other building blocks of APIs, showing examples of what is possible or by providing an API client to make calls to each API as part of the documentation. 
- **Reusable** -
