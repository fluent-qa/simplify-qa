## Test Automation 
Test automation is essential for delivering reliable and consistent APIs at scale across the enterprise. This is a blueprint for walking through the base of how test automation can work as part of a well-defined API lifecycle, helping teams standardize how they approach testing APIs. 

### Define 
The most important first step of any API lifecycle is to make sure the operations around an API are properly defined, laying the foundation for being able to effectively design and bring an API to life, while also establishing a known place, or places to go to get all the information you need regarding each individual API or groups of APIs. A little planning and organization at this early step of the API journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications and integrations that will depend on each internal, partner, or public API being delivered. 

- **Collections** - A machine-readable artifact that acts as a container for storing and organizing multiple API requests, providing an executable, self-documented reference for a complete API, a subset of an API, as well as workflows containing multiple requests from across many different APIs in a specific order, with a precise business function.

### Testing 
A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API accomplishes the intended purpose it was developed for, providing manual and automated ways to ensure an API hasn~t changed unexpectedly, is as performant as required, and meets the security expectations of everyone involved, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs. 

- **Contract Tests** -  
- **Performance Tests** -  
- **Integration Tests** -  
- **Security Tests** -  
- **Governance Tests** -

### Monitor 
All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren~t breaking their contract, falling below their agreed-upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible. 

- **Scheduled** -  
- **Regions** - Identify the region(s) where an API will operate so that you can comply with regulations and other business requirements and ensure that APIs are as close to consumers as possible.

### Build 
Tests can be automated using a CI/CD pipeline, allowing for tests to be executed every time a commit or pull request is made against a repo. Allowing tests to be run against any instance of an API, ensuring that any API being deployed has not broken its contract, and the API does what is expected. 

- **Source Control** - A systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large websites, APIs and other collections of information, providing a single source of truth for the code, artifacts and other assets powering API integrations and deployments, and details about each branch, commit, and conversation involved with move each individual API forward. 
- **CI/CD** - Operating in a state of continuous integration and continuous deployment involving APIs, ensuring that the process involved with consuming and producing APIs are as reliable, high quality, and resulting in consistent outcomes that benefit everyone involved, and powers useful applications. 
null 
### Observability 
Tapping into the outputs available across API operations to understand what is happening with individual APIs throughout their lifecycle, but also in aggregate for domains, teams, and other logical groups, helping make API operations more visible in real-time. 

- **APM** -  
- **Reports** - Visual reports that aggregate data from across operations, making APIs and the operations around them something that team members can see activity, history, and other dimension of what is happening across API operations, allowing different views to be organized and presented via dashboards.
