## Consumer Lifecycle 
The perspective of the lifecycle that speaks to the consumer experience, acknowledging that the API lifecycle is a two-sided affair, and that engagement with consumers is essential to each individual iteration of an API, but also the overall velocity each API will be able to achieve. 

### Stages 
These are the stages of a lifecycle for a consumer, helping offer a standardized set of stages for consistently delivering APIs. 

- **Discover** -  
- **Evaluate** -  
- **Integrate** -  
- **Test** - null 
- **Deploy** - Using an API gateway to deploy and manage APIs provides a single or federated approach to providing access to backend services using well-defined APIs, standardizing how APIs are published to development, staging, production, or other environments, while also consistently applying authentication, logging, and the other elements needed to properly manage APIs at scale. 
- **Observe** - View dashboards, reports, history, and logs to observe the state of a single API, the operations around it, and even across many different APIs and domains, taking advantage of the existing outputs that exist across operations to develop an awareness of API operations and how everything works.
