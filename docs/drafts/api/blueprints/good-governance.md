## Good Governance 
An API-first enterprise understands that good operations are defined by enabling teams to do the right thing on the ground floor. Good governance establishes a clear list of tools developers need for producing and consuming APIs, and makes sure they have access to them. Governance should augment the work of various teams involved in bringing APIs to life and putting them to work in the applications and integrations that power today’s businesses. 

### Elements 
 

- **Platform** - Set up your API platform, beginning with your source control, CI/ CD, gateways, and APM. Then evolve it towards other stops along the API life cycle, taking full advantage of the APIs behind your infrastructure to stabilize your developers. 
- **Integrations** - Lean on industrial-grade integrations to bring together the services you need to make producing and consuming APIs as seamless as possible for all stakeholders. Realize that APIs aren’t just for applications–they are also needed behind APIs. 
- **Tooling** - Empower developers with the tools they need, providing bedrock tooling like source control, CI/CD, and IDE. Encourage exploration of new commercial and open source tooling, providing tracks to formalize team adoption. 
- **Collaboration** - Modern API development teams aren’t locked away anymore. Producing and consuming APIs is a team effort across business and technical groups, providing a huge opportunity to improve productivity through more collaboration. 
- **Automation** - Help teams automate at every turn, documenting and then automating common processes that do not need human execution and intervention. Equip teams to bake workflows into the CI/CD pipeline as part of their work. 
- **Observability** - Make observability available to teams, allowing them to understand the health of their APIs and how they compare to other teams’ work. Encourage teams to learn from other teams and allow them to pick up new skills. 
 
Remember, the success of your governance is a direct reflection of the enablement you provide to teams. Nobody on the ground floor cares about governance, but they do want to be supported in doing the right thing. That support is much easier to provide with an API-first platform approach. When teams are fully equipped with the right training and tools to do the right thing in the moment, you will begin to see productivity and quality shift into a higher gear.

Teams across API operations will not always be aware of your strategy or care about the long-term impact of API governance. What teams want is to be enabled to solve the problems they have been tasked with. With good governance in place, you can make their workdays easier and more productive.
