## Consumer - Test 
API testing should be shared with consumers, opening up the possibilities for user acceptance testing. That will lead to greater trust and understanding of the reliability of a platform, and will strengthen the relationship between API producer and consumer. The results of API testing, including dashboards and visualizations, can be shared with consumers via workspaces and repositories, and alongside API documentation and portals. Go the distance–API testing plays an important role for both API producers and consumers. 

### Elements 
 

- **Availability** - Share uptime and availability information with consumers on a dashboard, providing transparency around the operation of the platform they will depend on for their applications and helping provide a historical accounting of availability. 
- **Contract** - Exposing contract tests and even the results of scheduled contract test runs will increase consumer awareness of API contracts and how their validation can be used in applications and integrations. 
- **Performance** - Share performance tests and results of scheduled performance test runs, increasing transparency about API performance while demonstrating how your platform has considered performance and is taking steps to improve upon it. 
- **Security** - Share your overall security policy and security test results, creating trust with consumers. 
- **Usage** - Explain that any type of consumer testing is not considered part of the usage they pay for and doesn’t show up as part of rate limits. That will encourage consumers to test an API and play a role in the feedback loop for your platform. 
- **SLA** - Provide an honest service level agreement (SLA) for each API, detailing expectations for services. Allow for beta, experimental, and less mature APIs, while demonstrating the production-ready grade of other APIs. 
 
To strike a balance between producers and consumers, your baseline testing should occur via a platform, bringing consumers into the conversation about API quality and holding producers accountable for platform quality.

Visibility and transparency at the testing level builds trust and ensures that API producers are truly considering the pain of consumers. Good API producers are also API consumers. They have been there, and felt the friction of onboarding themselves.
